Title: The Most Important Difference Between Bitcoin And Crypto
Date: Oct 2, 2024,
Content:
Representation of Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies are seen in this illustration photo taken in ... [+] Krakow, Poland on September 18, 2022. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Bitcoin is the first, most popular, and biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, many Bitcoin advocates draw a sharp contrast between bitcoin and the broader “crypto” space. Michael Saylor, founder of MicroStrategy and a bitcoin bull, voiced this on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." He said, "Speaking for all the bitcoiners, we feel trapped in a bad relationship with crypto, and we want out." Why such a stark divide between terms that appear closely related both linguistically and technologically? After all, every cryptocurrency is built on blockchain — a technology that allows transferring digital assets through a decentralized network, which maintains and updates the ever-growing transactions ledger. The essence of “bitcoin, not crypto” lies in the concept of decentralization. So far, no blockchain can compete with Bitcoin in this respect. However, we may still reconcile this perspective with the existence of other blockchains by recognizing the different purposes they serve. Decentralization is a solution to avoiding central authority flaws. Bitcoin is revolutionary in achieving a truly decentralized value transfer system, based on cryptology and economic incentive — new bitcoin and transaction fees paid to the miners. In return, miners invest in specialized hardware and spend a lot of electricity. They do this to find proof-of-work for each block, thus securing the blockchain. Miners are motivated to keep Bitcoin safe, operating, and most importantly, censorship-resistant. An alternative to PoW is proof-of-stake, which requires validators to stake the blockchain’s currency to prove their good intentions. This consensus and its variations are now the most popular among blockchains, as they allow for higher scalability. However, PoS can create an oligarchic system. The more coins you stake, the higher your chances of adding a block and earning a reward. This makes you wealthier, allowing you to stake more coins. Unlike bitcoin miners, whose power remains unchanged after mining a block, PoS validators can grow their influence. Furthermore, centralization concerns extend beyond the PoS consensus. A small number of nodes, liquid staking protocols pooling user funds, nodes hosted by centralized services, high hardware requirements, and centralization risks related to MEV (maximal extractable value) practices are just some of the problems that most blockchains must face. On Ethereum, one of the most decentralized blockchains other than Bitcoin, nearly 35% of staked coins come from the top three decentralized liquid staking services, according to Dune Analytics. Another 20% come from the top three centralized services. Additionally, 69% of Ethereum nodes are hosted by three centralized providers, and 90% of the blocks are ordered by just three MEV-optimizing builders. With 1.16 TB, Ethereum blockchain weighs almost twice as much as Bitcoin (604 GB), making participation harder for average users. Yes, most blockchains are much less decentralized and therefore less censorship-resistant than Bitcoin. Moreover, unlike Bitcoin, which Satoshi Nakamoto handed to the community less than two years after its launch, most other blockchains are still tied to their founders. This group of insiders, including early investors, often retains significant control, notably through pre-minted coins. This further concentrates their wealth and power. Does this mean that the whole “crypto” space is useless? It may be too early to say that. Decentralization is a spectrum, and even less decentralized platforms still offer users more freedom and control than traditional web services. This gives them the potential to serve various use cases beyond money. Bitcoin’s primary goal is to create and sustain independent money. As more people place their trust in bitcoin as an alternative to traditional currencies, its value grows accordingly. In contrast, most other blockchains, like Ethereum or Solana, were designed as multi-purpose smart contract platforms. Their goal is to enable the development of decentralized applications, called dapps. Using these blockchains, the next phase of the internet, known as Web3, could enable innovative use cases ranging from gaming and social media to finance, commerce, and beyond. In this perspective, ether, the native coin of Ethereum, is not a cryptocurrency. While it can be invested in or traded, ether is more of a utility asset for Web3 than general-purpose money. Its primary role is to power the Ethereum blockchain, functioning as payment for transactions and an incentive for validators. As Ethereum-based dapps gain popularity, demand for ether increases to cover transaction costs. Also, smart contract platforms’ founding teams often operate much like traditional companies. They deal with issues like finding investment, solving technical problems, building communities, and marketing their products. The value of these blockchains' native coins reflects the quality of this work, distancing them from the notion of independent currency. In the Web3 space, many consider such an organization necessary to innovate, and it’s hard to disagree. However, efficiency at the expense of decentralization goes against the cypherpunk ethos. This further increases the divide between Bitcoin and crypto. Web3 is buzzing with activity. Yet, according to DappRadar, the top 15 blockchains collectively register only 165 million unique active wallets per month. The future of the space will likely hinge on finding the right balance between decentralization and innovation. It will also depend on the teams’ ability to pass on their projects to the community when the time comes. Beyond native coins like bitcoin and ether, blockchains host a wide array of tokens, each with different functions and levels of decentralization. These tokens include stablecoins, memecoins, protocol tokens, and all sorts of digital units that anyone can easily create using a smart contract. The tokens share the blockchain environment with native coins, but their value depends on the project that issued them. For years, the tokens fueled bitcoin maximalists’ disdain for all crypto but bitcoin. Numerous crypto scams, mostly involving such tokens, have caused significant reputational damage to the crypto space. They have even tarnished bitcoin in the process. With the introduction of Ordinals and Runes, some bitcoiners have reconsidered their stance on tokens. These protocols, which assign value to satoshis (bitcoin’s smallest units) or create tokens on Bitcoin, have sparked discussions about new use cases for the blockchain. However, following the initial hype, both protocols now see only modest usage. Since their peak in 2023, daily Ordinals inscriptions have dropped from over 400,000 to around 40,000. Runes etchings have fallen from over 35,000 in April to fewer than 400. So far, bitcoin's role as a better form of money is its main use, overshadowing any other. In short, bitcoin remains unmatched in its decentralization and primary role as an alternative form of money. Meanwhile, the broader crypto space is willing to compromise decentralization for innovation and new use cases. As a result, bitcoin and crypto are growing increasingly distinct.  One Community.

Title: BBVA plans Visa-backed stablecoin launch in 2025 | Fortune Crypto
Date: 
Content:
BBVA is the latest financial giant entering the crowded field of stablecoins as the Spanish bank gets set to launch its own digital asset next year with the aid of Visa. In an interview with Fortune, BBVA head of digital assets and blockchain Francisco Maroto said the bank is currently in the sandbox phase of a new Visa program that helps firms launch their own tokenized assets, and wants to reach the prototype phase and live activity by 2025. BBVA has not yet decided whether the stablecoin will be backed by deposits, money market funds, or fiat currencies such as the euro or the U.S. dollar, said Maroto, who added that the company plans for it to be used for the settlement layer on exchanges. BBVA has been working in the digital asset space since 2014, and Maroto hopes that the latest project will let the bank benefit from the growing trend of the tokenization of assets such as real estate and private credit funds. “We realized that blockchain could transform the way we exchange value digitally, and consequently affect the way the financial system works,” Maroto said. Stablecoins constitute a broad category in the crypto space, describing any asset intended to maintain a specific price and backed by reserves such as fiat currencies, commodities, or even other cryptocurrencies. While the sector has existed for a decade, dollar-backed stablecoins such as USDC and Tether have exploded in popularity over the past few years, with their backing companies earning hefty profits through the yields on the underlying assets, which typically include U.S. Treasuries and other dollar equivalents.  Competitors from the traditional finance space have recently entered the race, including PayPal, which launched its PYUSD stablecoin in August 2023, as well as a bevy of overseas offerings that provide yield to their customers—an option restricted in the U.S. due to regulatory uncertainty. Last week, Visa announced a new product that would allow financial institutions such as banks to launch their own stablecoins, which Visa is calling fiat-backed tokens. While the use cases would vary, the idea would be for banks to choose the type of asset held as the reserve, which could vary from fiat currencies to deposits. While the tokens would initially work only within the bank’s own ecosystem, Visa head of crypto Cuy Sheffield told Fortune in April that the long-term plan would be to facilitate interoperability between different institutions, which is an advantage of more universal stablecoins such as USDC that can work across blockchains. Maroto said that BBVA wanted to work with Visa, rather than choosing an existing stablecoin option, because of Visa’s established brand and regulatory compliance. As one of the first financial institutions to experiment with the new product, BBVA also has the edge of operating mainly in Europe, which recently enacted stablecoin oversight.  Maroto said that BBVA will likely build its stablecoin around the euro, given its European presence, and that it could be used for settlement on exchanges that offer tokenized assets, with BBVA handling the mint and burn mechanism that converts fiat into crypto ecosystems.  Despite the goal of launching live testing next year, Maroto said that the U.S. is not on its short-term time horizon. BBVA currently offers the custody and trading of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC in Switzerland for private banking and institutional customers and is launching in Turkey.  © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Binance's Crypto Trading Market Share Drops to 4-Year Low: CCData
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by Crypto exchange giant Binance's lead over rivals melted to its narrowest in four years as rivals grabbed market share, CCData said in a Thursday report. Binance handled 36.6% of overall spot and derivatives trading volume on centralized crypto exchanges, the exchange's worst result since September 2020. Its spot trading dropped by nearly 23% from August, driving its spot market share down to 27%, the lowest reading since January 2021, the report said. The platform's derivatives trading also declined 21%, representing a 40.7% market share among centralized exchanges, the lowest level since September 2020. Binance representatives haven't returned a request for comment by publishing time. One of the beneficiaries of Binance's decline was Crypto.com, which grew its spot and derivatives trading volume by more than 40% on a month-to-month basis, CCData pointed out. Year-to-date, the exchange booked the largest gain in spot trading, increasing its market share to 10.5%. Overall, trading activity on crypto exchanges waned last month with derivatives and spot trading volumes both falling 17%, the report noted. September historically marks the end of a weak mid-year season in trading, giving way to a busier last quarter, CCData analysts said. "With catalysts such as increased market liquidity following the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut and the upcoming U.S. election, trading activity on centralized exchanges is expected to rise in the coming months," the authors wrote. Binance's waning dominance coincided with increasing regulatory pressure on the exchange. Last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a proposed amended complaint against Binance, scrutinizing the exchange's token listing practice. It was a follow-up on the regulator's June 2023 lawsuit, which alleged Binance operated as an unregistered broker, clearinghouse and trading venue, and offered unregistered securities. The exchange agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine to various U.S. regulators to settle those charges. The company's founder and former CEO Changpeng "CZ" Zhao pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four months in prison for violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by failing to set up adequate know-your-customer (KYC) systems at the trading venue. He was released last week. Read more: Binance Founder Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao Is a Free Man Edited by Aoyon Ashraf and Nick Baker.

Title: Coinbase Widens Access to Crypto B2B Payments
Date: Date not available
Content:
Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is expanding the ways businesses can pay. PayPal paid invoices to EY using the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin deposited into EY’s Coinbase Prime account, according to a Thursday (Oct. 3) news release. Coinbase Prime is a brokerage platform that facilitates trades, custody and prime services, according to the platform’s website. “An increasing number of Fortune 500 companies are approaching Coinbase to explore crypto payments,” Coinbase Director of Institutional Sales Steven Capozza said in the release. “Many are quickly moving from proof-of-concept exploration to full adoption.” Stablecoins can make B2B payments and treasury management faster, cheaper and more efficient because they settle instantly, including across borders, according to the release. They can also offer rewards to holders, boosting workflows for companies and their vendors. Like EY, Google Cloud and other companies have used Coinbase Prime to accept and custody crypto payments, the release said. “Requiring terms like ‘net-30’ for invoice payments can restrict cash flow and negatively impact business operations,” PayPal Director of Market Development Steve Everett said in the release. “With digital currencies like stablecoins, payments can be made 24/7, funds transferred near instantly and settled in near real time — enabling businesses to put their money to work faster.” The news came a month after Coinbase reported the first-ever crypto transaction between two artificial intelligence agents. “AI agents cannot get bank accounts, but they can get crypto wallets,” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a post on social platform X. “They can now use USDC on Base to transact with humans, merchants or other AIs. Those transactions are instant, global and free. He said the transaction marked an “important step” in AIs performing useful work, which they haven’t been able to do because they couldn’t transact to acquire resources. The CEO invited companies working on AIs and large language models that might benefit from having an integrated crypto wallet to conduct payments to integrate Coinbase’s wallet. “And if you are a company that sells a service — get ready for your shopping cart to be AI checkout enabled,” Armstrong said.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy  Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse discusses the possibility of an XRP ETF on 'The Claman Countdown.' Crypto asset manager Bitwise has submitted an initial registration statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission, signaling its intent to launch an XRP exchange-traded fund, FOX Business has learned. Bitwise, which manages over $4.5 billion in assets, submitted a Form S-1 registration statement to the SEC on Wednesday morning, making it the first firm to officially seek approval for a so-called spot ETF that would track the daily price of XRP, the seventh largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of more than $30 billion. The filing comes on the heels of Bitwise’s recent launches of spot bitcoin and ethereum ETFs, and its acquisition of ETC Group, a leading issuer of crypto exchange-traded products in Europe. EXODUS DONATES $1.3M TO CRYPTO ADVOCACY GROUP TO AID ELECTION DAY VOTE EFFORTS Despite this initial step, there's no guarantee that an XRP ETF could pass the regulatory muster of the SEC. Some applications for ETFs containing Solana, the No. 5 cryptocurrency, were recently rescinded with reports citing the SEC’s concerns over Solana’s legal status. Bitwise was not among the issuers to file for a Solana ETF and believes exposure to XRP will be a good opportunity for clients. "XRP is one of the most enduring, well-known assets in the space and is also recognized among mainstream investors," Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley told FOX Business. "At Bitwise we’ve always aimed to help investors access the opportunities in the space, and we’re excited to continue that work with our filing for a Bitwise XRP ETP." On Tuesday, FOX Business was the first to report the Bitwise XRP ETF filing that appeared on the State of Delaware’s Division of Corporations website. A Bitwise executive confirmed the filing was authentic. Another filing for an XRP ETF is listed on the Delaware corporation website from Canary Capital, a new crypto-focused investment firm established by Steven McClurg, co-founder and former chief investment officer of Valkyrie Funds. The website shows Canary XRP ETF was incorporated on Sept. 24. GRAYSCALE TO LAUNCH FIRST US XRP TRUST, PAVING WAY FOR POTENTIAL ETF McClurg had no immediate comment on the filing. For Bitwise, submitting the S-1 marks the beginning of a multistep approval process that could span several months. However, there’s no assurance that the SEC will approve an ETF containing XRP given the ambiguous regulatory status of many crypto tokens. This year, the SEC made headlines by approving the first bitcoin and ethereum ETFs for trading on Wall Street, indicating its assertion that the top two cryptocurrencies are not securities. The regulatory status of XRP, which currently trades at around 60 cents per token, has been hotly contested during years of litigation between the SEC and blockchain payments firm Ripple after the regulator sued the company in 2020 for failing to register sales of XRP, which it considered unregistered securities offerings. A judge handed Ripple a partial win last year when she ruled that only some of Ripple’s sales, the ones to institutional and not retail investors, constituted securities. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE The Bitwise XRP ETF filing comes at a pivotal time, as the SEC’s deadline to appeal the Ripple ruling is Oct. 7. If the agency appeals, the regulatory status of XRP could remain in limbo, potentially affecting how the SEC would view an XRP ETF. Despite initial pushback from financial regulators, bitcoin ETFs have become some of the most successful exchange-traded products in history, raking in $17 billion of inflows since January.

Title: Binance’s Crypto Market Share Drops to Lowest Level in Four Years
Date: Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 11:34 AM
Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Binance’s rehabilitative efforts appear to be slow to take root, with the largest crypto platform’s share of trading volume in the roughly $2 trillion digital-asset market falling in September to the lowest level in four years. Most Read from Bloomberg The Corner Store Comeback A Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda’s Capital City Gang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon’s Fast-Growing Cities A 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents Roofs of Mexico City’s Massive Food Market Will Power Public Buses The market share of the world’s biggest crypto exchange shrunk to 36.6% last month, down from 42.7% at the start of the year, according to researcher CCData. Binance’s 27% share of the spot market is the least since January 2021, while it accounts for 40.7% of derivatives trading, also the lowest in four years. Binance has been losing market share since March 2023, as it’s grappled with regulatory actions and increased scrutiny worldwide. Last year, it settled with the US Justice Department and several other agencies over charges including sanctions violations and agreed to pay a $4 billion fine. Its co-founder and then-Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao resigned and served four months in jail. Binance’s new CEO, Richard Teng, is a former regulator himself, and has been focused on talking with regulators scrutinizing Binance worldwide. Combined spot and derivatives trading volumes on all centralized crypto exchanges dropped 17% in September, typically a seasonally weak month, to the lowest level of monthly activity since June, according to CCData. Binance saw the most severe market-share decline last month among top exchanges, according to CCData. A Binance spokesperson didn’t immediately return a request for comment. Several smaller centralized competitors like Bybit, Bitget and Crypto.com have recently gained share, according to CCData. “This trend may reflect the growing confidence of crypto participants in other platforms, which offer a comparable user experience with low trading fees, minimal slippage, and high market liquidity,” said Jacob Joseph, senior research analyst at CCData. Earlier in the month, Binance became the first centralized crypto exchange to surpass over $100 trillion in lifetime trading volume, CCData said.

Title: Kamala Harris Is Courting Crypto Investors. Here's How She's Taking A Friendlier Approach Than Biden  - Benzinga
Date: Date not available
Content:
Kamala Harris is taking a different approach to cryptocurrency than President Joe Biden and she's making moves. Harris isn't just talking about being more crypto-friendly. She's already sending her aides out to build relationships with crypto investors and Democrats in Congress who support digital assets. Don't Miss: Her team includes Brian Nelson and Louisa Terrell, two people familiar with crypto. They've met with crypto executives and pro-crypto Democrats like Rep. Wiley Nickel, who said, "You're going to see a much more balanced approach from President Harris on this issue." Harris is positioning herself as more open to crypto than Biden. Recently, she discussed blockchain at a Wall Street donor event, signaling her intent to include crypto in her platform. "We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors," she said, outlining a vision that balances support for tech with caution. See Also: Dogecoin millionaires are increasing – investors with $1M+ in DOGE revealed! Harris' campaign hasn't commented publicly, but crypto investors are paying attention. She's seen as a more favorable candidate to the sector than Biden, who has ramped up crypto crackdowns. Crypto backers hope she might reverse some of the aggressive policies by SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Last year, the SEC brought 46 crypto-related enforcement actions, including a big case against Coinbase. The crypto community has felt under siege and Harris' approach could be a sign of relief. Trending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. Her team is also building alliances with pro-crypto figures like billionaire investor Mark Cuban, who's expected to personally lobby lawmakers on upcoming crypto bills. Cuban's involvement shows how serious Harris is about courting the industry, especially when contrasted with Donald Trump's recent endorsement of a crypto platform run by his sons. Crypto companies are also throwing big money into the 2024 election. According to Public Citizen, they've spent at least $119 million supporting candidates who back the industry. Harris' stance could help her win their favor, though she's still not seen as a full ally to the extent Trump is. "They're trying to figure out what the right place for her to be is," said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith, who has been in touch with Harris' team. Trending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today. In Congress, the battle over crypto regulation is heating up. Some Democrats like Sen. Jon Tester, once critical of crypto, are softening their stance, saying, "I always said we got to put side rails on it." But others, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, remain skeptical. Warren emphasized the need for rules to keep crypto from being used for illegal activities. Harris is navigating a fine line. Her friendlier tone on crypto is a marked shift from Biden, but it's still unclear how far she'll go in supporting the industry if she wins the presidency. For now, though, crypto investors are watching closely, hoping Harris is the change they've been waiting for. Read Next: © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

Title: The big boys want in on crypto, too - The Verge
Date:  Oct 3, 2024, 7:32 PM UTC
Content:
By  Elizabeth Lopatto, a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human behavior. She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg.  A little over a year after the collapse of the crypto banks Silvergate and Signature, financial institutions are very interested in crypto. PayPal has used its proprietary stablecoin to pay auditors Ernst & Young LLP, using a hub provided by SAP. Visa “is helping to bridge existing fiat currencies with blockchains” through its Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP). A lot has happened since those bank collapses, huh? We have a Bitcoin ETF, we have crypto bros meddling in politics, and a mini boom-and-bust cycle on Bitcoin prices. I have to assume PayPal and Visa got started on this stuff a while ago in order to get it popping now, but I do think it’s curious they are focused on stablecoins. Kinda seems like the big industry players are banking on stablecoins — and making their own “VTAP is a cutting-edge solution developed by Visa’s in-house blockchain experts,” Visa tells us cheerily. It’s a platform for banks to “mint, burn and transfer fiat-backed tokens, such as tokenized deposits and stablecoins, and experiment with use cases.” It’s supposed to go live in 2025, and BBVA has already said it is planning to use the platform to launch a stablecoin. Kinda seems like the big industry players are banking on stablecoins — and making their own, rather than using those created by, say, Tether or Circle. Some of that is making it easier for payments to cross borders; PayPal’s senior vice president of blockchain has said as much to Bloomberg. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup have been building their own blockchain capabilities. Tokenized money market funds are in the offing. Meanwhile, banks will be using the Swift messaging network to try out digital asset transactions next year.  Many of these experiments have been taking place outside the US. But it looks like crypto is edging closer to the banking industry; Bank of New York Mellon is closer to rolling out custody services for Bitcoin and Ether to support the ETFs, for instance. And there are incentives for banks to get involved — you can charge as much as 10 times more for safekeeping crypto, compared to normal assets. Crypto is a kind of tidal industry — with money flooding in during the booms and draining out during the busts. Looking at the institutional interest, I am wondering if we should get ready for another boom. But the closer a crypto boom comes to the traditional banking industry, the closer a crypto bust comes to that industry as well, something people involved with Silvergate and Signature can tell you for free.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

The list also includes Sui (SUI) and Bittensor (TAO), for which Grayscale just launched trust products in August, namely the Grayscale Sui Trust and the Grayscale Bittensor Trust. Grayscale believes Aave has the potential to revolutionize traditional finance by leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts. “Grayscale Aave Trust gives investors exposure to a protocol with the potential to revolutionize traditional finance,” Grayscale’s Head of Product & Research, Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, said. “By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, Aave’s decentralized platform aims to optimize lending and borrowing while removing intermediaries and reducing reliance on human judgment. Grayscale is known for its diverse range of crypto investment products. Aave Trust follows the debut of numerous single-asset investment trusts earlier this year, including Avalanche Trust, Near Trust, Stacks Trust, and XRP Trust. The Aave Trust is now open for daily subscription to eligible individual and institutional accredited investors. It functions similarly to Grayscale’s other single-asset investment trusts. Grayscale’s Aave Trust launched amid the strong growth of Aave V3. According to data from DefiLlama, Aave V3’s total value locked has surpassed $8.9 billion on Ethereum, up over 160% from around $3.3 billion at the start of the year.  Aave V3 features several key improvements to enhance Aave’s functionality and user experience. New functionalities like isolation mode and high-efficiency mode help users optimize capital usage while mitigating risks by limiting exposure to less liquid assets. In addition, cross-chain functionality allows liquidity to flow between different Aave markets across various networks, enhancing interoperability.

Title: Why crypto-loving Nigerians slashed their use of stablecoins by $14bn – DL News
Date: Date not available
Content:
About us Copy link  In a sign Nigeria’s crypto crackdown is making an impact, stablecoin volume fell a whopping 38% in the 12 months ending in July, to $23.6 billion, according to a Chainalysis, a blockchain intelligence firm. The sharp decline in Nigeria’s stablecoin utilisation flies in the face of the country’s ailing economy and devalued currency, the naira. Nigerians, long big users of crypto, should be piling into dollar-backed stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT to safeguard their wealth. Yet Nigeria’s bitter legal conflict with Binance and the clampdown on crypto exchanges appears to be dampening stablecoin usage. In February, Nigerian officials accused foreign crypto exchanges, including Binance, OKX, and KuCoin, of foreign exchange racketeering. These platforms, especially their peer-to-peer services, were flagged for causing a 90% plunge in the naira’s value against the dollar. Senior Nigerian officials alleged that swapping stablecoins for naira on those platforms was damaging the economy. Moreover, Nigeria focused its ire on Binance, which it accused of money laundering and facilitating illegal currency speculation.  In March, it charged Tigran Gambaryan, a US-based compliance executive, with money laundering and has held him in prison without bail for almost seven months. Binance and Gambaryan have rejected the allegations. Last week, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, implored Nigeria’s government to immediately release Gambaryan, a former federal investigator. Meanwhile, Nigerians are struggling to cope with terrible economic conditions. Inflation is soaring, the economy is shrinking, and households and businesses are finding it hard to access stablecoins to protect their wealth from devaluation. Foreign exchanges, including Binance, have dismantled their little apparatus in the country. Nigerians are now forced to rely on Telegram groups and other informal P2P dealers to access USDT. Still, platforms like Noones, a trading platform founded by Ray Youssef, former CEO of crypto exchange Paxful, are trying to fill the void left behind by Binance’s exit. Despite these challenges, Nigeria still accounted for 40% of Africa’s stablecoin transaction volume in the last year, according to a Chainalysis report released this week.  South Africa was a distant second, recording $14 billion in the period under review. Nigeria’s stablecoin adoption continues to be driven not only by retail users but businesses as well. Still, 85% of its stablecoin volume came from transactions under $1 million, the report stated. Nigeria’s crypto adoption in the last year did result in one notable feat. Africa’s most populous nation recorded $30 billion in total value received by DeFi services, according to the Chainalysis report. The achievement marks a major moment as it catapulted Africa to become the world’s leader in global DeFi adoption for the first time. In the previous reporting period, Africa ranked third behind India, North America, and Western Europe in DeFi adoption. According to the report, Nigeria’s DeFi adoption is largely driven by investors seeking to maximise returns from activities such as crypto lending. The trend marks an expansion of Nigeria’s crypto utilisation beyond stablecoin-based payment and remittance into more sophisticated markets. It also helped drive Nigeria’s overall crypto transaction volume to reach $59 billion, despite the stablecoin shortfall. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

Title: Crypto ETFs and SMAs: The Key Growth Drivers for Wealth Managers in a Competitive Market
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by In today’s issue, Nathan McCauley, co-founder & CEO of Anchorage Digital, explores how crypto could be a growth driver for advisors. In Ask an Expert, Marissa Kim from Abra Capital Management answers questions advisors may have about including crypto in their practice. – Sarah Morton You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. For wealth managers, crypto presents a key opportunity for growth – especially with rising mainstream interest after the approval of spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this year. As organic growth in wealth management declines and the marketplace becomes more crowded and competitive, crypto can help wealth managers drive client retention and reach new clients with a differentiated offering. Between the new spot ETFs and separately managed accounts (SMAs), wealth managers have a wide menu of options to offer crypto to their end clients. ETFs and streamlined adoption Spot ETFs present a streamlined path for wealth managers to offer crypto, especially for those who use ETF-based model portfolios. In recent months, some of the largest players – from major wealth management firms to Wall Street banks – have allowed advisors to offer crypto ETFs to eligible clients. The ETF wrapper has unlocked serious latent interest in integrating crypto into traditional portfolios, driving tens of billions of dollars into the digital asset class through a regulated and accessible investment vehicle. Competition amongst ETF issuers in the U.S., in particular, sparked fee compression for these products, benefiting crypto ETF shareholders. While spot crypto ETFs continue to be a significant unlock across mainstream and institutional finance, there are a few things wealth managers need to keep in mind. First, only SEC-regulated spot ETFs for bitcoin and ether are available on the market today. Like all spot ETFs, these products give shareholders direct exposure to – but not direct ownership of – the underlying asset. As a result, wealth managers should also consider other complementary avenues for crypto ownership, such as SMAs. Crypto SMAs as the next evolution With rising adoption of SMAs across the board and increasing interest in crypto as an asset class, crypto SMAs represent a perfect marriage. By combining direct ownership with professional management, crypto SMAs offer significant benefits for both wealth managers and clients alike. A qualified custodian serves as the base layer of a compliant crypto SMA. Today, wealth managers can access qualified custodians for crypto through turnkey asset management platforms, third-party technology platforms, and direct integrations. Safekeeping crypto with a qualified custodian gives end clients the regulatory certainty they need to participate in the asset class. For end clients, crypto SMAs unlock the ability to access a broader range of digital assets – beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. The SMA structure also allows for greater flexibility in portfolio construction, which means end clients can deploy more personalized investment strategies. End clients may also benefit from improved tax efficiency. For wealth managers, what does all of this mean? Greater client choice, which translates into enhanced client retention and differentiation from competitors in the market. By offering crypto SMAs, wealth managers can help future-proof their businesses – while providing the safety, security and regulatory certainty that clients have come to expect. Embracing crypto through SMAs and complementary vehicles like spot ETFs can help position wealth managers to play a leading role in financial innovation, driving both long-term client satisfaction and business growth. - Nathan McCauley, co-founder & CEO of Anchorage Digital Q: How large of an opportunity does crypto represent? We want to understand how much firm resources we should devote toward gaining knowledge of crypto products. It is estimated that about 50 million Americans (15%) already own crypto today, which means some of your clients likely already have exposure or are interested in getting exposure. Moreover, the adoption of cryptocurrencies is happening faster than the adoption of the internet, and we believe this participation rate may skyrocket over the next five years so that there will be significant demand from your clients. As the wealth transfer from Boomers to Millennials occurs over the next five to 20 years, we believe millennials will have greater interest in owning cryptocurrencies and are likely to want to hold those assets directly, versus through ETFs or ETPs. There are still ways for advisors to be value-add to this type of client, but it does require investment of time to learn how clients will want to access these assets and the full breadth of product offerings beyond the ETFs. Q: Where do digital assets fit into client portfolios from an allocation perspective?  Bitcoin is now being considered by some as a risk asset and as an asset that you would hold in a lower risk, defensive bucket, similar to precious metals or bonds. That being said, many advisors we speak to are only recommending to their clients exposure of 1-5% of total investable net worth to Bitcoin for now. Assets like Ethereum and Solana are still being considered mostly in a high-risk bucket, more similar to owning single high-growth technology stocks, which can have significant upside as adoption continues but will also continue to be volatile, which may not be suitable for large position sizing or for some types of more conservative investors.  Q: What will happen with the regulatory environment in the U.S. - should we wait to make recommendations until the landscape is more settled?  In general, there is uncertainty in the U.S. around how digital assets should be treated under current law and whether the SEC and/or CFTC have jurisdiction over certain assets. There are many inconsistent approaches from various U.S. agencies and active cases going through the legal system now that are starting to show where the gaps are. There have also been several bipartisan crypto-related bills proposed over the last year. While the industry certainly needs more regulatory clarity, BTC and ETH have some certainty following the approval of the spot ETFs, which confirmed that these assets are commodities - which is why these assets are likely to see increased institutional adoption. - Marissa Kim, head of Asset Management, Abra Capital Management Edited by Bradley Keoun.

Title: The AI-crypto power struggle - Marketplace
Date: Date not available
Content:

 




 All those fancy artificial intelligence systems need a lot of data centers to run, and those data centers need a lot of energy. One estimate from the Electric Power Research Institute suggests that U.S. data center electricity consumption will more than double by 2030, making up about 9% of all energy use. But the AI sector is coming up against the energy-hungry tech innovation of yesteryear — crypto mining. Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Reuters reporter Laila Kearney about the scramble to power up in both industries. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation. Laila Kearney: In a lot of the conversations I was having with power companies and with crypto miners, it was like, is this more of a competition, or is this more of an opportunity? And most people will say that it’s both. There’s not infinite amounts of power to go around, of course, so I am hearing from some crypto miners who were talking to utilities trying to get power contracts, thought they had some type of agreement in the bag and then realized that the contract had instead gone to an AI data center developer. If money, essentially, is the main factor in being able to get some of these data centers and contracts and land that are connected to power, then there’s not really a competition in that sense because there’s all this capital behind the technology industry versus cryptocurrency mining. Meghan McCarty Carino: So is that where the opportunity comes in, because you write about some crypto miners who are just pivoting their business to sell power to AI data centers, right? Kearney: Pretty much every big crypto miner is considering what they have to potentially market to AI data centers, but to build a cryptocurrency mining operation, it’s a couple of hundred thousand dollars per megawatt of capacity. To build a modern data center for AI, it’s about $7 to $8 million per megawatt of capacity, and that’s because these AI data centers are just much more sound, much more sophisticated. They require extremely involved and expensive cooling systems, so you can’t necessarily just roll out a bunch of [graphics processing units] for generative AI, you’re going to have to do retrofitting regardless. It’s an opportunity, and it’s being talked about a lot, especially because there is this giant deal between Core Scientific, the bitcoin miner, and CoreWeave. But that can’t necessarily be replicated even by a lot of the big bitcoin miners. McCarty Carino: Are there any crypto miners out there that are trying to outbid or push out their AI rivals? Kearney: Yeah. So I was talking to one big bitcoin miner, and they mentioned that one of the strategies that crypto miners are using right now in their conversations with utilities to try to get power contracts over, let’s say, an AI data center developer is by using the fact that crypto mining can be a flexible load, meaning that it can pretty rapidly turn on or off or curtail its electricity use. AI data centers cannot be interrupted. I mean, that would lead to massive losses, you know, in value. So that’s one of the ways that cryptocurrency miners are sort of pitching themselves. And so certainly, there are these conversations happening, and there’s the competition happening. McCarty Carino: Overall, how do you see this kind of interplay between these two energy-hungry industries playing out in the near term? Kearney: The big bitcoin miners, they own their land, they own or have long-term contracts for different energy supplies and assets, so they have something to lease or sell to data center developers that need power right away. And then there’s everyone else, all of the miners that range from like maybe a midsize company to someone who has a mining operation in their garage, they will be dealing with — along with everybody else who buys power from the grid — rising power prices in a lot of cases, and I think that will end up being really difficult for the smaller bitcoin miners, who don’t really have a lot to offer to this other industry. As far as the big bitcoin miners, they’re doing deals, they’re doing these kind of subcontracting deals and leases. And so it seems like there’s going to be more and more of a move towards that. McCarty Carino: Is AI going to be a pressure on kind of the crypto industry that starts to crowd out some of the players, just by virtue of, you know, even some of the opportunities that there may be in AI data centers, you know? Kearney: Yeah, I think that that’s pretty much the consensus now. And that is happening now to a kind of small degree. We’ve talked to some analysts who think that in the next couple of years, you will see about 20% of bitcoin mining go towards AI data centers. So yeah, I could see in the next couple of years, when these AI data centers are supposed to really get up and running, there being more and more of a shift by the big crypto mining companies towards AI, and instead of doing their regular mining business, leasing or selling for the purpose of generative AI and that type of thing. In early September, Elon Musk tweeted that the xAI data center in Memphis reportedly brought all of its 100,000 advanced Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, online at the same time — something of a milestone for any AI data center. Others have pointed out, though, that Musk might have exaggerated the point since no other AI company has managed to do the same, due to networking and connection limitations among GPUs and the energy limitations put on the xAI data center. According to reporting in The Information, xAI likely has access to only 50 megawatts of electricity currently, or enough to power about half the chips. My Marketplace colleague Samantha Fields recently reported that the U.S. electrical grid added more than 20 gigawatts of generation capacity in the first half of 2024.  But is that enough to meet rising demand from the tech sector?

But only last week did the two men actually meet face to face in a CNBC green room—an experience that Cuban says was illuminating.  “I told [Gary] this: You’re screwing the whole thing up, you’re pushing industries overseas,” Cuban said in an interview with Farokh Sarmad of Rug Radio, a sister company of Decrypt. “And honestly, I don’t think he got it.” The billionaire entrepreneur elaborated that it seemed like Gensler genuinely did not understand why the SEC’s “regulation by enforcement” approach to digital assets has been so unpopular. It appeared instead, Cuban said, like Gensler perceived himself as someone fighting a valiant battle against a nefarious new threat.  “I think he’s trying to be this public servant that’s saving the world,” Cuban said. “I think he’s got some of that Elizabeth Warren in him.” Warren, the senior Democratic senator from Massachusetts, has long denounced crypto as the primary tool used by both individual criminals and America’s enemies to evade existing laws and sanctions. This hardline stance has arguably earned her the title of chief “crypto villain” in industry circles—an accolade she may well now share with Gensler.  “She thinks that crypto facilitates that more than anything else,” Cuban said of Warren. “Because of that, crypto’s the bad guy in all this.” The former Shark Tank star said he is currently trying to schedule a follow-up meeting with Gensler to attempt to get through to him.  Last week, Cuban—an outspoken supporter of Kamala Harris’ presidential run—made waves by claiming that he would be open to taking over as SEC chair should Harris win in November. Cuban is currently one of the most prominent crypto advocates acting as a surrogate for the Harris campaign. Now, however, Cuban says that the whole thing was an act. He has no intention of taking a full-time job in the federal government—but says he floated the story out there anyway. “I always like fucking with the SEC,” the billionaire said. “I do not want to be the chairman of the SEC, [but] I wanted the conversation to happen to send a message to Gary Gensler that he’s doing it all wrong.” Cuban even says he’s outright told the Harris camp that if they win in November, he should be interviewed for the position for optics purposes. “I told them I don’t want to be the chair of the SEC, but it wouldn’t be a bad thing to interview me,” Cuban said. “Because it’ll send a message that the tenor of what you want going forward is not what we've got in the Biden Administration.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said that all virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region must comply with the newest set of anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, which were updated in July 2024. Companies that fall foul of the latest deadline could also face fines of up to roughly $155,000 (NT$5 million). The new set of AML rules is still undergoing drafts and is on track to be launched on January 1, 2025. Alongside the registration process, crypto firms will be required to meet capital requirements and provide “passive and active” protections under the new rules, according to reports in local media. These measures could include ensuring that the management of crypto firms has sufficient professional experience and that they do not have any prior criminal convictions. Taiwan introduced its previous batch of rules governing crypto AML in July 2021—but following the latest announcement, even fully compliant firms will have to re-register with the FSC to avoid punishment. In addition to the AML registration deadline, the Taiwanese regulator also plans to propose an additional “special law” governing crypto according to local media. The FSC reportedly looked to regulations in the European Union, Japan, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and South Korea when drafting the new law, which is on track to be released in June 2025. This law then needs to be approved by the Executive Yuan, Taiwan’s highest court. Taiwan’s regulations on crypto are also loosening up in some other respects, though. As per a separate announcement from earlier this week, some institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals in the East Asian country will now be able to trade foreign crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, there were a number of caveats. For example, a firm's Board of Directors must approve before the company can invest in crypto ETFs. Taiwan’s financial regulators have previously expressed suspicion about cryptocurrencies. In March, the Chairman of the FSA Huang Tianmu “said that virtual assets have no intrinsic value, but are highly volatile”. He also said that the “emergence of Bitcoin has nothing to do with the real economy” in an interview with a local publication discussing his plans to regulate the market.

Title: QCP: Crypto market weakness likely short-term
Date: October 3, 2024 at 2:58 pm
Content:

Share  Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East loom over Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but not for long, according to analysts. Ballistic missile attacks from Iran against Israel triggered a market selloff on Oct. 1, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), major altcoins, and the total cryptocurrency market tanking some 4%. Markets are still reeling from tensions in the Middle East. Bitcoin traded under $60,500, and market observers from QCP Capital predicted lower prices before a bounce. QCP analysts said BTC’s technical analysis suggested short-term bearish price action. Ether also slipped under $2,400, and Solana (SOL) retraced below $137 per crypto.news price data. Although October, historically a green month for digital assets, recorded consecutive red days, QCP surmised that current market conditions only represent a brief trend. We believe this weakness is temporary, given the strong correlation between crypto and U.S. stocks. As U.S. equities recover, crypto is likely to follow. This correlation highlights that macroeconomic factors are currently the main drivers of risk asset prices QCP Capital According to QCP’s Oct. 3 note, expected rate cuts and strong U.S. labor market data should slingshot Bitcoin and altcoins to higher prices. Bitget Research chief analyst Ryan Lee agreed with the bullish Bitcoin thesis in Q4. In an email shared with crypto.news, Lee noted a 16% drop in trading volume as investors observed geopolitical developments and macroeconomic happenings. However, Bitget’s expert also cited CryptoQuant data, which shows sustained institutional interest in Bitcoin. Despite the general downturn, institutional investors continue to buy digital currency at a rate at par or higher than the quantity mined daily, according to CryptoQuant. Currently BTC has sustained over the $60,000 support level and may fluctuate in the $72,000 range, the anticipation for Fed interest rate cuts and market rebound may come from Bitcoin’s historically optimistic Q4s.

Title: SEC Chairman Faces Congressional Wrath Over Crypto Regulation
Date: Last updated: 1 hour ago
Content:
Written By:Iyiola Adrian On Tuesday, Oct. 2, all 5 leaders of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appeared before Congress in a very rare meeting.  The meeting was led by Chairman Gary Gensler, who was blasted regarding his stance on cryptocurrency.  The nearly four-hour hearing hosted by the House Financial Services Committee was intense.  Lawmakers took turns challenging Gensler, voicing their concerns about the SEC’s strict approach to the growing crypto industry. One moment that really stood out was when Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) pressed Gensler about “Operation Choke Point 2.0.” a term used to describe an effort that the government is trying to stifle the growth of the crypto market. Gensler responded, saying, “I’ve never heard that term,” which surprised many people in the room following the rumors that he had discussed it with the Chair of the Federal Reserve behind closed doors. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), a big supporter of cryptocurrency, didn’t hold back his feelings. He said, “We could not have had a more destructive Chairman of the SEC,” making it clear SEC’s rules are hindering the growth of cryptocurrency in the country. I confronted SEC Chair Gary Gensler with a deceptively simple question: Is a Yankee ticket a security? Mr. Gensler claims that NFTs are securities.  I see no legal difference between a Yankee ticket that offers access to a Yankee game and an NFT that offers access to an… pic.twitter.com/4ykD4MFV8P To add to the drama, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce also spoke out during the hearing. She openly criticized the SEC’s unclear rules about crypto assets. “We’ve taken a legally imprecise view to mask the regulatory lack of clarity,” she said. Peirce went on to say that it is something that they should have “admitted to long ago” She also placed blame on the SEC’s tough stance squarely on Gensler, saying, “The agenda is the Chairman’s agenda.” Also Read: Gary Gensler Says It Again Bitcoin Is Not a Security

Title: Russian hackers are using deepfake porn sites to steal crypto
Date: 
4:17 PM • Oct 03, 2024 
Content:
Russian hackers are using a network of AI-based ‘nudify’ sites to deliver malware capable of stealing crypto wallet login details. As reported by 404 Media, cybersecurity researchers Silent Push discovered that Russian ransomware group Fin7 has created at least seven different AI-generated deepfake sites that create non-consensual nude images. The sites steal crypto credentials and other sensitive data using ‘RedLine’ and ‘Lumma’ malware. Users are infected after downloading the supposed nudify software through a Dropbox link, or by applying for a free trial, which also prompts users to download the malicious malware.   Read more: High treason charge for Russian man who ‘sent crypto to Ukraine’ According to Zach Edwards, a senior threat analyst for Silent Push, the nudify pivot targets “men with a decent amount who use other AI software or have crypto accounts.” “There’s a specific type of audience who wants to be on the bleeding edge of creepy (while ignoring new laws around deepfakes), and who are proactively searching out deepfake AI nude software,” Edwards told 404 Media.  Russian hackers are hot this week after the US took enforcement action against crypto exchanges Cryptex and PM2BTC, and a suspected money launderer for ransomware users and a number of other criminal enterprises.  On Wednesday, Russia announced that it arrested almost 100 people suspected of laundering on behalf of cybercriminals and hackers. Got a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

Title: Ripple and Mercado Bitcoin Partner to Transform Crypto-Enabled Cross-Border Payments in Brazil | Business Wire
Date: October 03, 2024 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
Content:

Ripple’s enhanced end-to-end payments solution is now available in first Latin America market
 SÃO PAULO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ripple, the leading provider of digital asset infrastructure, today announced the launch of Ripple Payments in Brazil. Mercado Bitcoin, Latin America's largest cryptocurrency exchange, will be the first customer in Brazil to utilize Ripple’s managed end-to-end payments solution, which enables businesses to easily leverage blockchain for faster, cheaper, more efficient cross-border payments in a secure manner. Customers can move funds across the globe 24/7, 365, and settle payments in a matter of minutes - reducing time and friction to make moving value dramatically more efficient.
  
This news builds upon last year's debut of new functionality that enables Ripple to manage payments end-to-end on behalf of its customers. Mercado Bitcoin will use the solution to improve its internal treasury operations between Brazil and Portugal, with plans to support international payments for its corporate and retail customers in the future. One of the differentiators is the use of a non-resident account, allowing users to pay directly in Reais, providing an improved customer experience.
 
Brazil’s leadership in the cryptocurrency market, progressive approach to policy and growing institutional and developer adoption made it a natural next market to launch Ripple Payments, for the benefit of businesses in Brazil. Ripple opened its local office in Brazil in 2019, and launched its first crypto-enabled payments solution in the market with Travelex Bank in 2022.
 
Ripple Payments offers a suite of benefits for Brazilian businesses:
 
"Ripple Payments offers unique capabilities that are important to crypto businesses enabling them to streamline operations, optimize liquidity, and ultimately improve margins through real-time payment settlement,” said Silvio Pegado, Managing Director of LATAM at Ripple. “We’re thrilled to partner with Mercado Bitcoin, a market leader in crypto with more than a decade of experience bringing tokenized services to Brazil.”
 
"The idea is to provide a simplified transfer through the expertise of Ripple, our international partner specializing in cross-border payments," says Jordan Abud, Head of Banking at MB. " At the same time, this partnership enables Mercado Bitcoin to take another step towards internationalizing its services. The possibility of facilitating this type of operation, offering lower costs and making the platform even more complete shows our commitment to customers, while expanding the portfolio of products we offer today.”
 
With its simple, secure, compliant digital asset infrastructure, Ripple is well positioned to provide the core services that financial institutions need to tokenize, store, exchange and move digital assets. Ripple Payments has near-global coverage with 80+ payout markets, which represent more than 90% coverage of the daily FX markets, processing more than $50B in volume. It has over a decade of experience in the digital asset space and holds 55+ regulatory licenses and registrations in various jurisdictions.
 
The product is not yet available to customers, and the first operation will be institutional, exclusively from Mercado Bitcoin to Mercado Bitcoin Portugal.
 
About Ripple

Title: ‘Operation Kraken’ in Australia Seizes Over $6,400,000 in Crypto From Global Organized Crime, Say Authorities - The Daily Hodl
Date: Date not available
Content:
A special law enforcement operation by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) has enabled authorities to gain access to crypto assets linked to the alleged mastermind and administrator of an organized crime app. Last month, the AFP arrested and charged Jay Je Yoon Jung for allegedly creating Ghost, an encrypted communication platform that authorities say is being used for criminal activities such as trafficking of illegal drugs, money laundering and ordering or killings. The 32-year old was arrested following an investigation by the AFP’s Operation Kraken. In a new statement, the AFP says that the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) successfully seized $6.4 million in cryptocurrency following an analysis of the devices that were recovered during Jung’s arrest. According to the AFP,  an analytics specialist managed to decipher Jung’s seed phrase, which allowed the investigators to access the funds and transfer these into an AFP wallet. Says AFP acting Commander Scott Raven, “The restraint of these assets shows the technical capabilities and powers that the AFP, and our partners through the CACT, are able to bring to bear on organized crime. Whether you have tried to hide them in real estate, cryptocurrency or cash, we will identify your ill-gotten goods and take them away from you, leaving you with nothing.” The AFP says investigations are still ongoing and the CACT will seek to have the restrained assets forfeited to the Commonwealth.

Title: Russian Hackers Are Using Fake AI Sites to Steal Crypto
Date: Last updated: 3 seconds ago
Content:
Written By:Iyiola Adrian Reviewed By:Jahnu Jagtap According to a report from 404 Media, Russian hackers are using fake AI websites as a trap to steal crypto wallet details. Silent Push, a cybersecurity firm, revealed that a notorious hacking group called “FIN7” is behind this scam. These websites promise users non-consensual nude images generated by AI, but when a user attempts to download the images, they unknowingly download the malware instead. This malware, known as RedLine and Lumma Stealer, is designed to collect login credentials and other sensitive data, including information from crypto wallets. Zach Edwards, a senior analyst at Silent Push, explains that the majority of people targeted in this scam are tech-savvy individuals interested in AI tools.  The hackers cleverly disguised these sites to appear legitimate. They make use of effective search engine optimization (SEO) tactics to ensure their sites rank highly on search results. The sites also appear professional, with options to upload images and generate deepfake nudes.  However, when users try to access their supposed images, they are directed to a Dropbox link that often doesn’t work, leaving them with nothing but malware on their devices. Silent Push has identified at least seven of these deceptive sites, including “aiNude.ai”, “easynude.website” and “nude-ai.pro.”  Although these sites have been taken down, experts warn that anyone who interacted with them should consider their devices compromised. The FIN7 has a long history of financial fraud, and they are connected to several ransomware gangs, including DarkSide and BlackMatter. These gangs are responsible for attacks like the $20 million ransom demanded from UnitedHealth.  They are also known for their clever phishing tactics, like pretending to be legitimate companies to trick people into downloading malicious software.

Title: SEC’s top crypto cop quits a month before election. Is Gensler next? – DL News
Date: Date not available
Content:
About us Copy link The US Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday that Enforcement Director Gurbir S. Grewal will leave the agency on October 11. Grewal, a 21-year agency vet, presided over 100 enforcement actions against crypto companies since 2021. He’s widely regarded as one of the key architects of the SEC’s anti-crypto “regulation by enforcement” strategy. “It’s not normal for an SEC Enforcement Director to get disappeared like this — gone on nine days’ notice with no replacement lined up,” Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant, a crypto venture capital firm, said on X. Sanjay Wadhwa, the Enforcement Division’s deputy director, will serve as acting director. It’s not clear who the SEC intends to promote to the role permanently. The news comes as Washington warms up to crypto ahead of the US election in November. Chervinsky couldn’t resist taking a shot at the SEC for its widely criticised approach to crypto over the last few years. “Perhaps the inevitable end to a campaign of unlawful harassment and misrepresentation resulting in many embarrassing defeats in court,” he said. In 2023, a US court of appeals ruled that the SEC erred by denying Grayscale, the crypto fund issuer, permission to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF. Then in August, the SEC was mostly unsuccessful in its long-standing claim that sales of crypto payments firm Ripple Labs’ XRP token had violated securities laws. With Grewal’s departure and political pressure mounting, crypto pundits are speculating on whether SEC Chair Gary Gensler could also leave the agency. Crypto investor Adam Cochran said on X that the short notice period and absence of a replacement for Grewal indicates that senior SEC staff are jumping ship fast. “The writing is clearly on the wall that Gensler is out next term in either administration,” he said. Former President Donald Trump has said he would fire Gensler immediately, should he return to the White House. Vice President Kamala Harris, has not commented on Gensler’s tenure. President Joe Biden appointed Gensler as SEC Chair in 2021. Other Democratic supporters haven’t been so restrained on the need for Gensler to go. “You leaving is worth a point in GDP growth,” Mark Cuban, the billionaire investor and Harris supporter, posted on X. In a recent interview on Fox News, Cuban said he would be open to replacing Gensler and heading the SEC should Harris win in November. Grewal isn’t the only SEC chief to leave the agency recently. In August, David Hirsch, the head of the SEC’s cyber and crypto enforcement unit, left to join Washington, DC law firm McGuireWoods. Tim Craig is DL News’ Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

Title: Crypto Asset Manager Grayscale Rolls Out Aave Trust
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by Grayscale’s has started a new fund which offers exposure to Aave's AAVE token, the asset manager said on Thursday, in what has been a series of novel products from the crypto asset manager. Aave is a decentralized lending platform based on the Ethereum blockchain that offers automated loans of cryptocurrency using other tokens you own as collateral. It also lets users lend out their crypto to earn interest. While the platform’s native token stands at a market capitalization of $2.3 billion, a relatively small number compared to most well-known tokens, the protocol has become the largest cryptocurrency lending protocol by total value locked (TVL), according to data by DeFiLlama. “Grayscale Aave Trust gives investors exposure to a protocol with the potential to revolutionize traditional finance,” Grayscale’s head of product and research, Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, said in a statement. “By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, Aave's decentralized platform aims to optimize lending and borrowing while removing intermediaries and reducing reliance on human judgment,” she said. The launch comes only a few weeks after Grayscale rolled out its most recent fund, the Grayscale Avalanche Trust, offering investors exposure to the AVAX (AVAX) token. The asset manager currently offers over 20 different crypto investment products, a number that has grown after the launch of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January, which spurred interest for publicly tradable products tracking cryptocurrencies. Grayscale is the issuer of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the Grayscale Mini Bitcoin Trust (BTC), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH), which all launched earlier this year.

Title: Nakamoto Speaks: Dogecoin Creator Reacts to Crypto Market Bloodbath
Date: Date not available
Content:
As we enter the tenth month of the year, the cryptocurrency market continues to struggle, having already lost over $213 billion in total capitalization since the beginning of the week. Most of this decline is, of course, due to the fact that the market's flagship, Bitcoin, failed to break through a key level of dynamic resistance at $66,000.  The negative price action was accompanied by a panic among market participants due to the worsening geopolitical situation in the world.

 Markus-Nakamoto, in a recent post on social network X, where he has more than two million followers, played out a kind of dialogue in which, asking whether the crypto market can stop falling and return to a phase of unstoppable mania, the market responds to him with a famous meme phrase from "post-aged" Captain America from the movie "Avengers: Endgame" (2019).  hey crypto can you stop crashing and go back to unsustainable mania please crypto: pic.twitter.com/J9CP5utpsx Markus' disappointment is understandable, as it is shared by other traders and investors who believed in Uptober.

Title: Indiana Man Pleads Guilty to Stealing Over $37,000,000 in Crypto From Nearly 600 Victims: US Justice Department - The Daily Hodl
Date: Date not available
Content:
A 21-year-old man from Indiana just pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a cyber intrusion event that happened in February 2022. Malicious actors involved in cyber intrusion use phishing, email infection, SQL injection and other means to gain access to computer systems with the aim of causing harm or stealing sensitive data. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) says that Evan Frederick Light illegally obtained the personal identifiable information (PII) of one of the clients of a South Dakota-based investment holding company. He then used this information to compromise the company’s computer servers and unlawfully access the PIIs of hundreds of other clients. He eventually stole over $37 million worth of crypto assets from 600 victims who held funds with the investment holding company. Light used mixing services and gambling websites to conceal his identity and hide the stolen assets. Says U.S. Attorney Alison J. Ramsdell, “Although this defendant tried to hide in the shadows of a cyber underworld, he was not beyond the reach of our team, and today’s guilty verdicts should serve as a reminder that this Office and its law enforcement partners will bring cyber criminals to justice, regardless how sophisticated their crimes may be.” Light was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments. The DOJ says he committed the crime with one or more unidentified perpetrators. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Bybit Integrates DEX Trading in WSOT 2024 To Promote Collaboration for the Crypto Community - The Daily Hodl
Date: Date not available
Content:
 DeFi (decentralized finance) and CEXs (centralized exchanges) often exist as separate entities – and as the crypto industry continues to grow, the need to connect these parallel forces becomes more apparent. By bridging this divide, these two sides of the same coin can create a user-friendly and better-integrated crypto ecosystem. Bybit, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is pushing toward a better-connected crypto space by incorporating DEX trading into its WSOT 2024 (World Series of Trading). This is the first time a decentralized trading option will be included in the global competition and marks a substantial step for a unified crypto trading community. The WSOT competition has become an important event for the global trading community, rewarding the skills of individual traders and teams alike for over four years. In 2022, WSOT attracted over 69,000 participants, rising to 117,000 in 2023. This year’s competition introduces the WSOT DEX Wave and DEX Pro, aiming to create a collaborative environment for builders, traders and ecosystem partners for all corners of the crypto space. DEX Pro will enable traders to access over one million DeFi tokens – including GameFi tokens, memecoins and other DeFi projects – unlocking a wider market than any predecessor WSOT event. Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit said, “By integrating DEX trading into WSOT 2024, we’re providing traders with the opportunity to explore both the centralized and decentralized sectors of crypto. This year’s competition offers a unique chance to experience every element of the digital assets market.” WSOT 2024 features a prize pool of up to 10 million USDT, including exclusive luxury rewards such as Rolex watches, global travel tickets and even a whole yacht. These incentives are in place to draw in the maximum range of participants, attracting newcomers and veterans who wish to test their trading skills on the WSOT stage. This year’s competition will usher in a tiered weighting system that prioritizes strategy and showcases talent rather than resource advantages. Traders will also be able to use subaccounts, enabling them to maximize rewards through one main account and up to four supplementary ones. The new competition structure will also introduce an ROI reset card that helps level the playing field further, allowing traders to reset their ROI (return on investment) if needed. To further support the Web 3.0 ecosystem, Bybit is collaborating with Immunefi and the Ethereum Foundation to empower Ethereum’s first Attackathon. Bybit will contribute up to 75 ETH to the global event aimed at improving the Ethereum network’s security and innovation. With the introduction of DEX trading, new key feature additions and huge prizes and rewards for participants, Bybit’s WSOT 2024 is ready to connect the centralized and decentralized sectors for a truly inclusive and unified Web 3.0 ecosystem.

Title:  Here’s what happened in crypto today  — TradingView News
Date: Oct 3, 202413:32 UTC
Content:
Today in crypto, banks in North America, Europe and Asia are preparing to participate in trials involving digital assets, which will be hosted by SWIFT. The SEC filed a notice of appeal in the Ripple lawsuit, seeking to overturn an earlier ruling from Judge Analisa Torres. Ripple says it is evaluating whether to file a cross-appeal. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju said Bitcoin whales aren’t in a position to offload their sizable holdings. Banks to join SWIFT digital asset trials in 2025 The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) announced on Oct. 3 that it will begin digital asset trials on its network in 2025. The trials will involve experiments with transactions that include multiple digital currencies and assets. The trials aim to explore how the banking network can provide financial institutions with unified access to “multiple digital asset classes and currencies.” In the announcement, SWIFT highlighted the rapid growth of unconnected platforms and technologies in the digital asset economy that has led to an “increasingly fragmented landscape.” According to SWIFT, such fragmentation poses significant impediments to global adoption because it creates a “complex web of ‘digital islands.’” SWIFT stated: Ripple CEO: ‘We’ll fight in court for as long as we need’ Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse has vowed to fight the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in court “for as long as we need.” “Somehow, they still haven’t gotten the message: they lost on everything that matters,” Garlinghouse wrote in an Oct. 2 X post, deriding the SEC’s appeal notice. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a notice of appeal in the Ripple lawsuit on Oct. 2, 2024, seeking to overturn an earlier ruling from Judge Analisa Torres. Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty wrote on X that the SEC’s appeal was “disappointing, but not surprising,” adding it was “evaluating whether to file a cross-appeal.” Bitcoin whales won’t rock the boat — for now CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju said Bitcoin whales have yet to accumulate enough unrealized profits to begin dumping their large holdings on the market. In an Oct. 2 social media post, the analyst said newer Bitcoin whales — those holding the assets for up to five months — would only realize a profit of 1% if they decided to dump their holdings now.  While older whales have fared better, they “haven’t seen particularly higher returns” during the current market cycle, said Ju.  In Ju’s view, whales are unlikely to sell a portion of their holdings until retail investors return to the market.  The Bitcoin price has seen renewed volatility this week amid heightened Mideast tensions. Some analysts believe Bitcoin could fall to around $54,000 as investors continue to bid up traditional safe-havens, such as gold. Traders and investors use our platform.

Title: Crypto.com Becomes One Of The First Cryptocurrency Platforms To Achieve PCI DSS V4.0 Certification - FinanceFeeds
Date: October 3, 2024
Content:
Crypto.com, a trusted and leading global cryptocurrency platform with over 100 million customers, has once again set an industry milestone by becoming one of the first cryptocurrency platforms to upgrade its Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) certification from version 3.2.1 to the latest v4.0 standard. This monumental achievement underscores Crypto.com’s unwavering commitment to providing the highest levels of security, privacy, and regulatory compliance in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency sector. The PCI DSS v4.0 certification represents the most recent and comprehensive version of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, designed to address the ever-evolving security requirements of the global payment industry. The updated v4.0 framework builds on the previous 12 core security requirements, introducing enhanced methods for continuous security monitoring, improving data protection, and providing greater flexibility in achieving compliance. Although the deadline for the cryptocurrency and payment industries to adopt PCI DSS v4.0 is set for March 2025, Crypto.com has taken proactive measures to become one of the first cryptocurrency platforms to meet this standard ahead of schedule. This achievement signals to users and industry partners that Crypto.com remains ahead of the curve in adopting the latest and most stringent security protocols. In an environment where the threat landscape is continuously evolving, achieving the PCI DSS v4.0 certification is a testament to Crypto.com’s forward-thinking approach to data protection. By implementing the new security framework, Crypto.com ensures that it is well-prepared to safeguard sensitive user data and transactions from emerging cybersecurity threats. “The security of our platform has always been a top priority,” said Jason Lau, Chief Information Security Officer at Crypto.com. “Achieving PCI DSS v4.0 certification further solidifies Crypto.com’s unwavering commitment to data privacy and security by design. We are relentless in our pursuit of maintaining the highest standards, ensuring our customers can trust our products with confidence.” This latest achievement adds to a growing list of security milestones that Crypto.com has reached. Over the years, the platform has consistently demonstrated leadership in compliance and cybersecurity by obtaining a wide range of internationally recognized certifications. Crypto.com was the first virtual asset service provider to achieve several key certifications, including: These certifications collectively reinforce Crypto.com’s position as a leading virtual asset service provider with a foundation rooted in trust, privacy, and security. They also reflect the platform’s ability to adhere to the highly regulated standards often required in traditional financial industries. “Our PCI DSS v4.0 certification is a milestone that demonstrates our commitment to not only meeting but exceeding industry standards for security and compliance,” said Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com. “We will continue to invest aggressively in our platform to ensure we maintain the highest levels of trust with our users, giving them the confidence they need to engage with cryptocurrency safely.” Since its founding in 2016, Crypto.com has rapidly grown into one of the most trusted and widely used cryptocurrency platforms globally. With a vision of “Cryptocurrency in Every Wallet™”, Crypto.com is dedicated to accelerating the adoption of cryptocurrency through innovation, regulatory compliance, and user trust. The platform is built on a foundation of security, privacy, and compliance, aiming to create a fairer and more equitable digital ecosystem for users worldwide. As the industry leader in regulatory compliance, Crypto.com has taken an active role in shaping the future of the cryptocurrency sector by adhering to the strictest global standards for security, privacy, and data protection.

Title: Santiment Reveals That Toncoin, Shiba Inu, PEPE, And This Crypto ICO Are The Top Trending Projects » The Merkle News
Date: Date not available
Content:
ETFSwap (ETFS) is trending in the crypto community, with many analysts and key opinion leaders (KOLs) discussing its potential. These well-known individuals predict that the ETFS token will enjoy up to 20,000% price gain from its current price of $0.03846 in its crypto ICO. With such a bullish outlook for ETFS, investors have been rushing to buy as many tokens as possible in the crypto ICO. These investors know they could make generational wealth from ETFSwap (ETFS) once it records its 20,000% price gain. This bullish outlook for ETFS and its crypto ICO isn’t just based on mere hype. Instead, these experts have analyzed ETFS’s utilities and say it will attract impressive demand when the ETFSwap investment platform launches. ETFS is the native token of ETFSwap, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that will offer tokenized exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and enable them to be traded on-chain. Investors who want to invest in these tokenized traditional assets will need the ETFS token, which they will swap for their desired ETF. The ETFSwap team, certified by SolidProof, has partnered with MiCA-regulated investment banks to offer securities and crypto trading. This means that investors will now be able to invest in both ETFs and crypto assets in one place. ETFS also plays a major role in this offering since investors will need to swap it for their desired crypto asset. ETFSwap (ETFS) essentially bridges the gap between traditional finance and the DeFi world. Investors will be able to convert their ETFs to crypto assets and vice versa using the ETFS token. The DeFi token also provides access to several other commodities on the platform including gold, silver, rubber, crude oil, and cotton, among others. ETFSwap (ETFS) also provides access to other offerings and features on the DeFi platform. For instance, token holders enjoy exclusive investment opportunities like the platform’s ETFS, which will launch in 2025. These holders will be able to use artificial intelligence (AI) powered trading tools on the platform to execute more successful trades. These tools, ETF Screener and ETF Tracker provide investors with the best ETF recommendations, ensuring maximum gains in this market cycle. It won’t be long before these investors start enjoying these incredible offerings. The ETFSwap team announced that the platform’s beta version will go live soon. In line with this, investors have been buying ETFS in its crypto ICO, so they can use the ETFSwap beta platform as soon as it launches. Seeing how investors are rushing to buy the DeFi token in its crypto ICO, there is no doubt about the immense demand it will enjoy once the main platform launches. Onchain analytics platform Santiment revealed that Toncoin (TON), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) are seeing the fastest-rising discussion rates in crypto. Toncoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE are currently trending for different reasons.    For Toncoin, there has been a lot of discussion around the Hamster Kombat airdrop. Shiba Inu’s discussions have centered around its burn rate and upcoming projects, while some analysts argue that PEPE hasn’t achieved significant growth like other meme coins. However, these analysts remain bullish on ETFSwap (ETFS) and its crypto ICO than on Toncoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE. Toncoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE are unlikely to record anything close to the 20,000% price gain that ETFSwap (ETFS) is set to enjoy. ETFSwap (ETFS) is a better investment option than Toncoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE. Therefore, investors shouldn’t waste time participating in its crypto ICO, with tokens fast selling out. Early investors stand to gain a 200x return on investment when the token records its 20,000% price gain. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

Title: Crypto Analyst Benjamin Cowen Issues Ethereum Warning, Says ETH Could See Bearish Q4 If History Repeats - The Daily Hodl
Date: Date not available
Content:
Popular crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that Ethereum (ETH) could suddenly turn bearish in the last three months of the year. Cowen tells his 861,500 followers on the social media platform X that ETH may be repeating a similar 2016 pattern on the monthly timeframe that could have it seeing red in the fourth quarter. However, he says if ETH follows a similar pattern, it may put up big gains in the first half (H1) of next year. “With ETH going green in September, the 2016 pattern is still tracking. If it continues to play out, it would mean Q4 is red, followed by green H1 2025. Q4 2019 was also red for ETH, but October was slightly green. Trends can change, but worth following until it deviates.” Ethereum is trading for $2,375 at time of writing, down 3.3% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst suggests that Tether Dominance (USDT.D) may have to break below the trend line on the weekly timeframe for Bitcoin (BTC) to start rallying because it would indicate market participants are using their stablecoins to accumulate crypto assets. According to Cowen, a declining percentage of Tether’s market cap relative to other cryptocurrencies has a historic relationship with Bitcoin uptrends. “I posted USDT dominance hitting its long-term trend line on March 14th, 2024, which was the local top for BTC. We all have a way of convincing ourselves that this time is different, but USDT dominance has been putting in higher lows ever since. This trend line needs to break before any real future rally can begin.” Lastly, the analyst shares a chart of the logarithmic regression band of crypto’s market cap, which is designed to track the fair value of an asset class using “non-bubble data.” He says that based on historical precedence the crypto market may not soar past fair value into the overvalued area until early next year. “Last cycle, we went durably overvalued by the end of the halving year. But the cycle before that, it wasn’t until the first or second quarter of 2017. The cycle before that, it wasn’t until the first quarter of 2013. So again, we might experience a market that doesn’t durably go overvalued until potentially next year. And if it did that, it wouldn’t really be out of the ordinary. It would actually still be in line with what we saw the cycles do previously.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Australia's Police Confiscates Crypto Worth $6.4M in Crackdown on 'Ghost' Messaging App
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by Australia's police has confiscated $6.4 million in cryptocurrency as part of a global crackdown on Ghost, an encrypted communications network, authorities allege was “built solely for the criminal underworld,” a statement said. The seizure of the cryptocurrency comes two weeks after the AFP arrested a Sydney resident Jay Je Yoon Jung, 32, the alleged mastermind behind Ghost. He appeared in a Sydney court on Wednesday to face the charges. Another man who allegedly distributed the app has also been arrested. The seized crypto has been transferred into secure AFP cryptocurrency storage and the authorities will seek its permanent forfeiture. The effort is titled Operation Kraken but Kraken the cryptocurrency exchange "has not been the subject of any Operation Kraken investigations," an AFP spokesperson wrote in an email to CoinDesk. "Operation Kraken was an investigation into a dedicated encrypted communications platform." A Kraken spokesperson said, “We’re disappointed by this operation’s codename, which has absolutely nothing to do with our brand." The crackdown last month saw 700 AFP members execute 93 search warrants, arresting 46 people, intervening in 50 threats to life, and seizing 30 illicit weapons and 200 kg of illicit drugs, the AFP said.

Scan QR code to download the app. Table of Contents Blog › Academy › Is Coinbase Wallet Safe? A Comprehensive Review  Coinbase Wallet is a popular digital wallet that enables users to securely store and manage their digital assets. It is owned and operated by Coinbase, a centralized cryptocurrency exchange based in San Francisco. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at Coinbase Wallet’s features, security, and user experience to help you decide if it’s the right wallet for you. We’ll also discuss some pros and cons of using Coinbase Wallet to help you make an informed decision. Hi! I’m Zifa, your dedicated guide to the expansive world of cryptocurrency. With an unwavering passion for all things crypto, I’ve spent years immersing myself in this dynamic field, deciphering its complexities and trends. But what truly sets me apart? I believe it’s my knack for distilling difficult concepts into simple language. Consider it my superpower — transforming intricate blockchain labyrinths into digestible pathways of understanding. Join me as we explore the crypto cosmos together, one blog post at a time. I’m thrilled to have you on board! Table of Contents Coinbase Wallet is a non-custodial mobile and browser extension digital wallet that lets users securely store and manage their cryptocurrencies and NFTs. It serves as a bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies, delivering an intuitive interface for users to access their digital assets anywhere. Coinbase.com is one of the most popular cryptocurrency brokerage platforms in the market today. It allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies easily and facilitates instant exchanges. The main difference between Coinbase.com and Coinbase Wallet is the way it stores its crypto assets. On Coinbase.com, store crypto assets are stored on their online exchange; however, these crypto assets are out of user control, which makes them vulnerable to external hacking or attacks. On the other hand, Coinbase Wallet offers a more secure way to store your crypto holdings in a self-custody wallet. This means users can retain full control over their funds as they will be stored in an individual, personally owned wallet instead of on an exchange or broker site like Coinbase. Furthermore, many features make this wallet convenient and user-friendly — think of allowing people to make payments with just one tap using their phone’s contact list, along with supporting over 100 different coins and tokens, including Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and more.  A self-custody wallet, also known as a non-custodial wallet, is a type of digital wallet where the user has full control over the private keys associated with their cryptocurrency. This stands in contrast to custodial wallets, where a third party, like a cryptocurrency exchange or a bank, holds the private keys. In a self-custody wallet, you are solely responsible for managing your private keys, which also means you have complete control over your cryptocurrency assets. The wallet will generate a cryptographic pair of keys — a public key, which is your wallet address, and a private key, which is used to sign transactions. When you initially configure your Coinbase Wallet for your Coinbase account, it creates a recovery phrase, often called a “seed phrase.” This phrase, consisting of 12 simple words, acts as the master password to your wallet, ensuring access to all your cryptocurrencies and NFTs as long as you remember it. Self-custody wallets can be either software-based, installed on your computer or mobile device, or hardware-based, like a USB stick. The foremost advantage of a self-custody wallet is the exclusive access you have to your funds, providing a level of security and privacy not typically available with custodial wallets. However, with great power comes great responsibility. If you lose access to your self-custody wallet, either by misplacing the device or forgetting your password, recovery is nearly impossible. This is because there is no third party holding a backup of your private key. In essence, a self-custody wallet grants you total control over your cryptocurrency, giving you both the freedom and the responsibility that comes with it. Your choice here largely depends on your individual needs and comfort level when managing your own security. A self-custody wallet is like being your own bank. You have total control over your cryptocurrencies because you’re the only one with access to your private keys. This gives you maximum privacy and independence but also comes with the responsibility of safeguarding your keys. As my experience suggests, if you’re tech-savvy and value control over convenience, a self-custody wallet could be the right choice for you. On the other hand, a custodial wallet involves a third party, like a cryptocurrency exchange, managing your private keys. This can offer some advantages, such as easier access to trading and other services, and the possibility of account recovery if you forget your password. However, it also means you’re trusting another entity with your assets, which could be a risk if that provider is compromised.In my opinion, neither is universally better than the other. It’s about evaluating your personal requirements, understanding the trade-offs, and choosing the solution that fits your needs best. Always remember, “not your keys, not your coins” is a fundamental principle in the crypto world, but the convenience and additional services of custodial solutions can’t be overlooked either. Get the top 50 crypto definitions you need to know in the industry for free Coinbase Wallet stands as a feature-rich and versatile digital wallet catering to the diverse needs of a modern cryptocurrency user. It combines a user-friendly interface with robust security measures, making it an attractive choice for novice and experienced users. At its core, Coinbase Wallet provides enhanced security to safeguard users’ crypto wealth. It supports compatibility with hardware wallets like KeepKey, Ledger, and Trezor, adding an extra layer of security. This integration ensures a comprehensive system for securing cryptocurrency both online and offline. Furthermore, the wallet’s security is bolstered by the Secure Enclave feature, a sophisticated technology developed by Coinbase for protecting private and public keys. Biometric authentication adds another dimension to this security, ensuring that access to crypto funds is restricted to authorized users only. Additionally, optional cloud backups are available. They offer a safety net for recovering lost private keys and crypto assets. One of the unique aspects of Coinbase Wallet is its functionality in the realm of digital collectibles. As non-fungible tokens (NFTs), such as Crypto Punks and Kitties, gain popularity in the digital consumer marketplace, the wallet provides a seamless solution for storing these NFTs. Moreover, it facilitates NFT sales and purchases across the internet, thus integrating the wallet into the vibrant NFT market. While Coinbase Exchange offers built-in insurance, Coinbase Wallet extends a vendor insurance policy to its users. This policy is designed to protect users’ funds against security breaches, malicious activities, fraud, and vandalism. It ensures that users are covered for losses if someone gains unauthorized access to their wallets. To enhance its user experience, Coinbase Wallet underwent significant updates on December 5, 2023. These updates include the ability to send crypto via text message on popular social media messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. Global, instant, and free money transfers to friends and family directly within messaging and social media apps through a secure link from the wallet emphasize its commitment to user convenience. In addition to these features, Coinbase Wallet allows users to connect their cryptocurrency bank accounts. This functionality streamlines transactions with digital currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, ensures that funds are managed directly on the user’s device, and eliminates the need for centralized brokerage or exchanges in the transaction process. In summary, Coinbase Wallet offers a comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly platform for managing cryptocurrencies and digital collectibles. Its advanced security features, combined with the innovative approach to NFTs and peer-to-peer transactions, position it as a leading choice in the digital wallet space. Yes, Coinbase Wallet is generally considered safe. In fact, many view Coinbase Wallet as one of the safest hot wallets available today. Its robust security measures, like 2FA, biometric authentication technology, and Secure Enclave for private key protection, play a key role in securing user assets. Plus, its recovery phrase feature provides a safety net in case of device loss.  Coinbase Wallet gives users complete control over a wide range of crypto assets. Account holders can easily connect their existing exchange accounts to the wallet. Apart from being convenient, this also provides a crucial layer of protection in case of mismanagement of funds, such as the November 2022 FTX bankruptcy. In the event of a security breach or unexpected loss of digital assets, Coinbase Wallet has an additional layer of protection against potential security threats — insurance coverage for user funds. Still, it’s worth remembering that even Coinbase Wallet isn’t completely invulnerable. As a hot wallet, it’s perpetually online and, therefore, more susceptible to online threats compared to cold storage solutions. Moreover, its linkage to Coinbase’s services means any security or service issues at Coinbase could have a ripple effect on users. Also, user mistakes can lead to loss of funds. Misplacing a recovery phrase, for example, could result in permanent wallet access loss. Conversely, if a malicious party discovers a user’s recovery phrase, they could gain unauthorized access. While Coinbase Wallet stands out for its cost-efficiency and user control, its history is not without security breaches. In 2021, a security flaw in Coinbase’s account recovery system led to at least 6,000 Coinbase user accounts being compromised. However, the company quickly rectified the vulnerability and reimbursed affected users. Despite the 2021 incident, Coinbase has shown resilience against numerous infiltration attempts. In 2019, Coinbase’s security detected and thwarted a large-scale attack that could have resulted in billions of dollars in losses. This attack, involving spear phishing, social engineering, and zero-day exploits, earned Coinbase commendation for its deft handling. Nonetheless, as the 2021 incident underscored, user accounts on the crypto exchange aren’t impervious to hacking. If advanced hackers access personal information, such as your address, passwords, and phone number, they could potentially gain access to your account without even needing to infiltrate Coinbase systems. If you’re looking for safer alternatives, consider hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger for cold storage or software wallets like Electrum for a balance between usability and security. Remember, security in the crypto world is a constant trade-off between safety, convenience, and user control. Always factor in your personal needs, technical capability, and risk tolerance when choosing a wallet. And ensure you use a strong password to enhance the security of your chosen wallet. Coinbase Wallet offers a range of services to its users, including support for Ethereum ERC-20 tokens, a link to DeFi projects, and participation in airdrops, ICOs, and NFT collections. The wallet also allows users to browse dApps and shop at crypto-friendly stores, making it a one-stop base for all things crypto. Users can connect with Coinbase customer support through the wallet app or their website’s support page. In case of any issues, they can also reach out to Coinbase’s support team via email or phone. The fee structure for Coinbase Wallet is designed to be straightforward and transparent, ensuring users are aware of potential costs associated with their transactions. Since there are no fees for transfers between Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase Exchange, users benefit from the seamless movement of cryptocurrencies between the two platforms without additional costs. However, users should keep in mind that when transacting on the blockchain, network fees, commonly known as miner fees, may apply. These fees are not specific to Coinbase but are part of the blockchain’s transaction processing requirements. The amount of these fees can vary — it depends on several factors, including network congestion and the size of the transaction. This means that fees can fluctuate, and the current state of the network matters greatly. When engaging with decentralized applications (dApps) or making transactions on the Ethereum network, users may incur gas fees. These fees are necessary for the execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and can vary depending on the complexity of the transaction and the current network demand. Additionally, Coinbase Wallet has implemented a fee of 1% on swap transactions. This fee applies when users exchange one type of cryptocurrency or token for another within the wallet. The revenue generated from this fee is reinvested into the wallet’s overall functionality, contributing to the development and maintenance of the platform. In this part, we’ll closely examine Coinbase Wallet’s pros and cons so that you can determine if it’s the right wallet for you. Let’s dive in! Coinbase Wallet has a wide range of use cases that cater to various user types. To existing Coinbase users, the wallet offers an additional layer of security and control over their assets. They can easily transfer their crypto assets to the wallet and enjoy the benefits of decentralized storage. People with diversified crypto portfolios can also benefit from using Coinbase Wallet: after all, it supports various types of cryptocurrencies like ERC-20 tokens and has a user-friendly interface that allows for easy trading and exchanges. Users can access and manage their assets from different devices and switch between a hot and a cold wallet for added security. NFT traders can take advantage of Coinbase Wallet’s support for digital collectibles. The wallet supports non-fungible tokens, making it an excellent choice for those interested in the NFT market. The advantages of Coinbase Wallet are numerous. It offers users easy access to exchanges and transactions without a third-party service. Additionally, the wallet gives users control over their assets and eliminates the need for custodial accounts. Users can also enjoy regular security audits and extra layers of security, such as biometric authentication and recovery phrases. The Coinbase Wallet browser extension enhances user experience by allowing seamless access to your wallet directly from your desktop browser.  In my journey exploring Coinbase Wallet, I noticed it’s not without its imperfections. While offering a host of features, it leaves users yearning for more control over their private keys. The wallet’s non-custodial nature is somewhat overshadowed by its reliance on Coinbase’s services, which puts users at the mercy of potential security lapses or service outages on the platform. Furthermore, I’ve observed that the transaction fees can pile up, particularly for smaller transactions — a pitfall one should consider. Adding to the downsides, customer support, in my experience, has room for improvement. The limited responsiveness can cause frustration, especially when urgent help is needed. Lastly, as a product linked to a centralized exchange, Coinbase Wallet may not be suitable for crypto enthusiasts who prioritize decentralized finance and self-custody. The wallet does not support all types of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications, leading to a limited experience for those looking for more flexibility. Overall, while Coinbase Wallet offers convenience and a user-friendly interface, these potential drawbacks should be considered before choosing this wallet as a long-term solution. For users looking for alternative crypto wallets, there are several options available in the market. If you want secure cryptocurrency storage, the Trezor One is considered one of the top-rated hardware wallets. It supports over 1,000 cryptocurrencies and works with all the major computer operating systems. Not only is it easy to set up and use, but it also stores your private keys safely offline, so you don’t have to worry about your funds becoming vulnerable online. Metamask is another great option if you prefer a crypto wallet you can use in your web browser. It’s downloadable as a browser extension for Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Brave, as well as an Apple or Android app, giving users plenty of options when dealing with their coins.  Some other popular alternatives to Coinbase Wallet include Trust Wallet, Atomic Wallet, Exodus, MyEtherWallet, Trezor, and Ledger Nano S. These wallets offer unique features such as additional layers of security, support for various cryptocurrencies, and compatibility with different operating systems. When comparing Coinbase Wallet and Trust Wallet, there are a few key differences that users should be aware of. Coinbase Wallet is more business-friendly and geared towards more experienced crypto investors, allowing for direct access to the Coinbase exchange and trading features. Trust Wallet, on the other hand, is more user-friendly and has a simple interface for beginners, though it lacks direct exchange connections. Both wallets offer ongoing product quality and support features, with security updates and new features being added regularly. However, Coinbase Wallet has the extra benefit of being backed by a well-established and respected cryptocurrency exchange, while Trust Wallet is a stand-alone wallet with no connection to any particular platform. Overall, the choice between Coinbase Wallet and Trust Wallet will depend on the user’s individual needs and preferences. Those looking for direct exchange connections and more advanced trading features may prefer Coinbase Wallet, whereas beginners may find Trust Wallet more user-friendly. Regardless of the choice, ongoing product quality and support will ensure a safe and user-friendly experience. Coinbase Wallet is a digital wallet that allows users to store, manage, and transact various cryptocurrencies. The answer is yes and no. Coinbase Wallet itself is free to download and use, meaning there are no upfront costs or subscription fees to worry about. However, there are transaction fees associated with using the wallet. These fees typically range from 1% to 4% of the transaction value, depending on various factors such as network fees and the type of cryptocurrency being transferred. Network fees can be particularly unpredictable and volatile, as they are determined by current traffic and demand on the blockchain networks that support each cryptocurrency. As such, it’s important to keep an eye on these fees before making any transfers to ensure you’re not overpaying unnecessarily. No, Coinbase and Coinbase Wallet are not the same. Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange platform where users can buy, sell, and trade various cryptocurrencies. It operates more like a brokerage, where the platform holds the cryptocurrency on behalf of its users, and they do not have direct access to their private keys. On the other hand, Coinbase Wallet is a separate application that functions as a digital wallet, allowing users to store and manage their own cryptocurrency holdings. While both are offered by the same company, their functionalities and purposes are distinct: one is for trading and managing investments on the exchange, and the other is for personal storage and management of cryptocurrency. Withdrawing funds from your Coinbase Wallet is a straightforward process that can be accomplished quickly. First, you should link your Coinbase Wallet to a crypto-friendly bank account. This will allow you to transfer funds directly from your wallet to your bank account. Once your account is linked, navigate to the Withdrawal page in your Coinbase Wallet and select Bank Transfer as the withdrawal option. From there, select the linked bank account, enter the desired withdrawal amount, and submit the request. Processing times may vary depending on the specific bank and network used to complete the transfer. However, once the transaction has been confirmed, your funds will be deposited directly into your bank account. Coinbase is considered a good cryptocurrency wallet by many due to its user-friendly interface, security features, and reliability. It is one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets available, and it offers support for a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase also has insurance coverage for stored funds, which provides an added layer of security. However, some users have reported issues with customer support and high transaction fees.  Coinbase Wallet and Trust Wallet are both non-custodial wallets, offering a similar level of security by allowing users full control over their private keys. Both wallets also support cloud backups, enhancing their safety and recovery options. While their user interfaces are also quite comparable, each wallet has distinct additional features. Trust Wallet supports a variety of cryptocurrencies and enables direct staking within the app, appealing to users interested in earning rewards. On the other hand, Coinbase Wallet offers seamless integration with the Coinbase exchange platform, facilitating easy transactions between the wallet and exchange.  Read our Trust Wallet review here.  Drawing on my experience in the crypto field, I’ve found Coinbase Wallet to be a robust and reliable platform for managing digital assets. Its top-notch security measures, such as cold storage, two-factor authentication, and insurance coverage, offer peace of mind that’s hard to find elsewhere. The wallet is designed for various cryptocurrencies and offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface accessible via mobile apps. Unique features such as a recovery phrase and biometric authentication add an additional layer of security that I personally appreciate. Yet, no solution is perfect. With Coinbase Wallet, the trade-off comes in the form of higher transaction fees and a lesser degree of control over private keys. Also, customer support can leave you waiting, which can be frustrating. Nonetheless, Coinbase Wallet emerges as a trustworthy choice for storing and managing crypto assets. Its drawbacks notwithstanding, it stands tall as a popular choice in the market. If convenience and security top your checklist, Coinbase Wallet shouldn’t disappoint you.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available. The situation has started to get worrisome for XRP as selling pressure is increasing. The XRP price is also significantly down today as bears have taken control of the market. The more troubling thing is that XRP is one of the most poorly performing coins in the last few days. Coins like Bitcoin (BTC) also faced declines, but not major ones compared to XRP. Amid this negative situation, XRP whales seem to be losing hope as they increase selling pressure. Crypto tracking service Whale Alert has detected three huge XRP transfers to top crypto exchanges. These potential sales have injected bearish sentiment into the market as no price gains are expected in the short term. In the first transfer, a notable investor transferred about 17.94 million tokens from their private wallet to Bitstamp. This transaction is estimated to be worth around $10.2 million, based on the current XRP price. Shortly after, Whale Alert detected another big transfer from another major investor. The second transfer carried around 22 million XRP tokens to the trading platform, Bitso. It was also transferred from the investor’s private wallet, and it is currently worth around $11.7 million. While the market already witnessed these two potential sales, Whale Alert later detected one more major XRP transfer from a major whale. In the third transfer, about 20 million XRP tokens were sent from a private wallet to Binance, the biggest crypto exchange on the market. This transfer is estimated to be valued at $10.7 million. Collectively, almost 60 million XRP coins were transferred to three different crypto trading platforms, and they are valued at around $32.6 million. The price of XRP has struggled amid these potential sales from whales. As of this publication, the Ripple-associated coin is trading at $0.5177. It has seen a massive crash of 11.59% during the last 24 hours. The current situation is serious for XRP, as the price seems to be going down further. If whales continue the selling pressure, the market may see more losses.

Title: Tesla Billionaire Elon Musk Issues $35 Trillion U.S. ‘Bankruptcy’ Warning—Predicted To Trigger A Bitcoin Price Boom

Apply now! The bitcoin price has dropped to almost $60,000 per bitcoin, wiping away most of the gains it made following China's bombshell. Now, after Elon Musk revealed the details of his secret meeting with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, the Tesla billionaire has warned the U.S. heading for bankruptcy after the country's debt jumped $204 billion in one day. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has warned the U.S.'s could collapse into "bankruptcy" due to its debt ... [+] spiraling out of control—something some think could turbo-charge the bitcoin price. "America is headed for bankruptcy," Musk posted to X, the social media platform he bought and rebranded from Twitter, linking to a report of U.S. debt surging on October 1. "Federal debt explodes on 1st day of the new fiscal year, jumping $204 billion to new record of $35.669 trillion, but it gets worse: Treasury also had to draw down its cash balance by $72 billion—that's over $275 billion in the red for just one day," EJ Antoni, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, posted. Last month, Musk met with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, who made history when he adopted bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador in 2021, with Bukele predicting the U.S.'s days could be numbered. U.S. debt interest payments are forecast to hit $870 billion this year, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office earlier this year after runaway inflation pushed the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a never-before-seen clip in the aftermath of huge Covid-era spending and money-printing. U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures. "As both Republican and Democratic parties do not appropriately address the ever-increasing U.S. debts and deficits during this election, this will be very bullish for bitcoin especially post the U.S. election," CK Zheng, chief investment officer of crypto hedge fund ZX Squared Capital, told Cointelegraph. Earlier this year, Bank of America analysts warned the U.S. debt load is about to ramp up to add $1 trillion every 100 days—potentially fueling a bitcoin price surge—and could reach $36 trillion by the end of 2024. Last month, the Fed kicked off its interest rate cutting cycle, taking the market somewhat by surprise with a 50 basis point reduction and fueling expectations of a similar sized cut in November—described as "crazy" by BlackRock's chief executive.

[+] billionaire Elon Musk and others warn over the huge U.S. debt pile and fears swirl of U.S. dollar collapse. Bitcoin price swings this week come as tensions rise in the Middle East between Israel and its neighbors, with fears growing the regional conflict could spiral to a wider war—highlighting bitcoin's role as a U.S. dollar and debt hedge. "Observers of bitcoin prices this week would once again note that it is not a safe haven against geopolitical concerns," Geoff Kendrick, head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, wrote in an emailed note. "I think this is normal. Gold is a geopolitical hedge. bitcoin is a hedge against [traditional finance] issues such as bank collapses ... or de-dollarisation/U.S. Treasury sustainability issues."

Title: Taiwan Implements New Anti-Money Laundering Rules for Crypto Firms
Date: Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 6:19 AM
Content:
Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has announced new anti-money laundering (AML) regulations targeting virtual asset service providers (VASPs). These regulations, which require VASPs to complete AML compliance registration by September 2025, will take effect on January 1, 2025. According to local media reports, failure to comply with the new AML registration requirements may result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment for up to two years and fines reaching NT$5 million (approximately $155,900). The draft regulations come in the wake of amendments made to Taiwan’s financial laws in July. According to the FSC, all VASPs, regardless of their previous compliance status, must adhere to the new registration requirements. This marks a significant shift from the previous AML obligations established in July 2021. Kevin Cheng, a crypto lawyer and secretary general of the Taiwan Fintech Association, emphasized that non-compliant operators will face criminal liability. He noted that compliant operators will encounter stricter regulatory obligations, effectively aligning the crypto industry more closely with licensed financial institutions. The new rules introduce additional qualifications for management teams and emphasize corporate responsibilities, including transaction security and consumer asset protection. As part of its ongoing regulatory efforts, the FSC is also considering a specific law proposal for crypto assets, which is expected to be submitted to Taiwan’s Executive Yuan in June 2025. The draft proposal is anticipated to be completed by the end of this year. In a related development, the local crypto sector established an industry association in June to create self-supervisory rules under government guidelines. The FSC's latest move aims to enhance legal protections for Taiwan's crypto industry, potentially attracting larger investors accustomed to traditional finance. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Could Rollblock Be the Next 1000x Crypto Like Polygon?
Date: 3. October 2024
Content:
When it was a new crypto, Polygon (POL, formerly known as MATIC) returned 1,000x. This is the stuff of legends, except not really. While 1000x cryptos are rare, they are not unheard of. BNB itself is a 100x crypto. Now, Rollblock steps into the fray. Can this new online casino be the next 1,000x crypto? Evidence is it may just be! Let’s go see it. When BNB launched as a new crypto in 2017, it was priced at a mere $0.52. Imagine stepping back in time and putting a thousand bucks in BNB. Nobody could have predicted this would be the next 1000x crypto, but when BNB peaked at $718 in June this year, it returned 1380x for its early investors. This is how people like CZ became billionaires. It’s evident, and just mathematical, that BNB will never do 1000 again. But that does not mean other coins will not. When Ethereum was a new crypto, it was beset with scaling problems. Polygon stepped up and solved all Ethereum’s problems, and it spiked just shy of 1000x in a mere two years. Polygon was the king of Ethereum scaling solutions, but sadly, Polygon had its day. Ethereum has since fixed a lot of its own scaling solutions, and the need for Polygon just isn’t here anymore. It’s sad to see Polygon go, but we can see it off with a nod of thanks for the service it provided the crypto markets. What do Polygon and BNB have in common? Utility. These tokens have a purpose – even if that purpose is now obsolete, like with Polygon. Many tokens merely ‘exist’ without a use case, while those that solve real-life problems turn out to be the next 1,000x crypto. This is why Rollblock has seen several thousand subscribers invest over $4 million of liquidity into its new online casino. The Rollblock RBLK token has utility. Like how BNB powers Binance, RBLK powers Rollblock, the first-ever online casino built on the Ethereum chain with no KYC requirements and an alluring play-to-earn model.  Online gambling is a massive half-a-trillion-dollar industry but has been beset by problems like cheating, hacks, and fixed games. Rollblock changes all that. Its publicly auditable Ethereum architecture ensures no fixing going on behind the scenes and no hackers jimmy the games. It is the solution online gambling has been crying for since the invention of the internet. On the casino floor, Rollblock is not playing games, at least not as far as product offerings are concerned. Rollblock sports over 150 games, from traditional casino fare to bespoke Web3 games to sports betting. There is something for everyone on Rollblock. As for investing, the utility of the RBLK token comes clear with their revenue share model. All token holders get paid a weekly dividend from the income generated on the dApp! Rollblock delivers a deflationary token and residual income, making it the perfect investment coin for short-term gain and long-term sustainability. Rollblock is now in its seventh phase of presale at $0.003. The same price Polygon was as a new crypto before it became the next 1,000x crypto!  Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Title: Kraken launches Bermuda-based crypto derivatives venue 
Date: October 3, 2024 at 7:06 pm

Share  Kraken has expanded its offshore with a new derivatives trading venue in Bermuda, licensed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority. Kraken, a major global cryptocurrency exchange, has launched a new derivatives trading platform in Bermuda after securing a digital asset business license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority, according to a company press release. The move comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission increases scrutiny on crypto exchanges, pushing firms like Kraken to seek offshore opportunities. With the BMA license, Kraken can now offer its clients a range of crypto derivatives, including perpetual and fixed-maturity futures, using various types of collateral, such as fiat currencies and over 30 cryptocurrencies, the release said. Derivatives are financial contracts that allow users to speculate on or hedge against the future value of assets. They have become a key feature in crypto trading and account for most of the trading volume globally. Offering derivatives helps clients manage risk efficiently while capitalizing on market opportunities. Bermuda has become an attractive destination for crypto businesses due to its clear regulatory framework. Kraken joins other major players like Coinbase and HashKey Global, which have also received BMA licenses.  Kraken’s new platform enables round-the-clock trading, reflecting the 24/7 nature of the crypto market, and aims to attract clients looking for a regulated venue with a broad range of derivatives products.

Title: Japan Reforms Crypto Gaming Laws: What To Expect
Date: Last updated: 3 hours ago
Content:
Written By:Rajpalsinh As crypto gaming is catching global attention via new games like Hamster Kombat, Japan, a country full of gaming enthusiasts, is preparing itself to embrace this new realm. As per the latest report, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) has announced plans to amend key laws governing cryptocurrency in gaming.  By revising the Payment Services Act and creating a new legal framework for managing in-game digital currencies, the Japanese regime wants to create an environment for crypto-gaming innovation while ensuring safety for players.   The regulatory move comes after Japan observed a growing need for integrating blockchain technology into its robust gaming sector. The proposed changes are expected to streamline legalities and attract more international crypto-gaming projects. If this happens, it will solidify Japan’s role as a hub for crypto gaming. While this new regulation will be limited to Japan’s territory, it can become a case study for other countries to embrace innovations related to crypto.   For gamers, Japan has always been at the center of gaming culture, no matter what day it is. From classic arcade games to globally popular console games like ‘Final Fantasy’, ‘Pokémon’, and ‘Super Mario’, Japan’s active participation in the gaming world is legendary.  According to the report, The global video game market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.4% from 2023 to 2030, reaching USD 583.69 billion by the end of 2030. In 2022, the Asia-Pacific region held the largest market share, accounting for over 48%. In this report, Japan is one country that major gaming studios want to capture.  As the gaming world is now integrating blockchain technology to build in-game assets and NFTs, Japan could once again play a pivotal role, this time in the crypto-gaming sector. The intersection of Japan’s gaming culture and crypto technology offers a fertile ground for innovation.  Japan’s established gaming industry and a tech-savvy population, make it a perfect combination for the integration of blockchain-based gaming ecosystems.  The Payment Services Act is an important legal framework that regulates the use of cryptocurrencies and other financial services in Japan.  According to an anonymous FSA official, they are “exploring changes that would make it easier for companies to manage in-game assets without compromising the security and transparency of the financial system.” The new amendments in the Payment Service Act seek to streamline the process of how corporations handle in-game crypto assets as well as ease the regulatory challenges that crypto gaming companies are currently facing. These changes are also important for retaining Japanese web3 startups, preventing their move to more crypto-friendly regions. The recent announcement by the FSA shows that the agency plans to amend this act to serve the unique needs of the crypto-gaming industry.  The current Payment Services Act regulates cryptocurrency transactions by requiring exchanges and service providers to register with authorities and comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and customer verification (KYC) requirements.  The proposed changes are expected to loosen some of these restrictions to ensure smooth integration of in-game currencies and assets. The new legal framework will likely include specific provisions for managing in-game tokens, NFTs, and other blockchain assets in order to create a safe environment for players as well as developers.  Globally, crypto gaming has already grabbed many headlines with sensational games like Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, and Decentraland leading the way. These games allow players to earn cryptocurrency by playing, making the “play-to-earn” model an appealing alternative to traditional gaming. Japan, too, has caught on to this craze, with a growing number of crypto games gaining popularity among its gaming community. Popular gaming models like “play-to-earn” encourage players of the new generation to grind and stay engaged in the game. By simply completing a task or through a ‘PvP’ battle, players can earn cryptocurrencies.  For example, My Crypto Heroes, a blockchain-based role-playing game developed in Japan, has gained a great following. This game contains Japan’s rich RPG tradition with cutting-edge blockchain technology. Another game, Brave Frontier Heroes, uses NFTs to enhance player experiences, giving gamers ownership over their in-game assets. First things first, there are a lot of misconceptions related to cryptocurrencies in common people. People from outside of the crypto space see it as an illegal asset, which is completely wrong.  Now, when crypto is going to be part of the wider community, the government should ensure that it educates and ensures the safety of users through crypto regulations.  Rules governing the creation, distribution, and trading of in-game digital assets will be essential. These rules will need to ensure that in-game tokens comply with AML laws and are safe from illegal activities like fraud or money laundering. Furthermore, The new amendments in the Payment Service Act should include the law to ask game developers to provide transparent information about how in-game currencies and NFTs are managed and traded.

The Aave platform is a decentralized lending protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to earn interest on their deposited crypto assets and to borrow against them. The interest rates are set by the market, and the Aave protocol ensures that borrowers always pay more than they receive. This system is designed to be trustless and transparent, with all transactions being recorded on the blockchain. Aave was founded in 2017 in Switzerland. Up until the rebranding in September 2018, Aave was known as ETHLend. Unlike traditional lending platforms, Aave does not require a credit check or other financial data. The platform doesn’t even need orthodox collateral. Instead, borrowers are able to use their crypto assets as collateral. This makes it possible for anyone with crypto funds to access lending services. In addition, Aave uses a unique protocol called “flash loans.” Flash loans are short-term loans that can be taken out and repaid in a single transaction. This makes them ideal for traders who need to quickly take advantage of market opportunities. Lastly, the platform has a built-in staking mechanism that enables Aave users to earn interest on their crypto holdings. This incentivizes users to hold their assets on the platform and helps ensure that the Aave ecosystem remains healthy and robust. Together, these features make Aave a unique and powerful lending platform with immense growth potential. Built on the Ethereum blockchain in compliance with the ERC-20 token standard, AAVE is a native token of the Aave network. Platform users benefit from holding AAVE tokens — for instance, they pay reduced platform fees. AAVE is a governance token that empowers users to vote on decisions that may influence the platform’s evolution. Aave is one of the leading protocols in the DeFi space, and its native token, AAVE, is one of the most popular tokens on Ethereum. Aave has been operational since January 2017 and has seen significant advancement in recent months. The protocol is currently used by over 100,000 users, with over $5 billion worth of assets locked in its contracts. Can’t load widget

Aave network is developing rapidly. AAVE price forecast for 2025 is rather positive. The AAVE average price is expected to reach minimum and maximum prices of $179.82 and $214.83 respectively. AAVE is provided with suitable environment to reach new heights in terms of price. AAVE price prediction is quite positive. Business analysts predict that AAVE might reach the maximum price of $1,307.87 by 2030. Please take into account that none of the data provided above is neither fundamental analysis nor investment advice. None of the information provided is $1,082.89 Aave is not a coin: it is a token. It is a native cryptocurrency of the Aave platform. However, you may come across references to incorrect information, such as an “Aave coin price forecast,” etc. Learn more about the difference between coins and tokens in this article. Aave first debuted in 2017. Back then, it was named ETHLend; the company changed the token’s name to Aave in September 2018. Serial entrepreneur Stani Kulechov established Aave. Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that enables users to lend assets in   for interest payments and to borrow a variety of cryptocurrencies directly from one another. Aave tokens traded at their minimum AAVE price of $26 in November 2020, according to CoinGecko. Aave’s past performance on the market makes many investors wonder if AAVE is a good investment. While there is no simple answer to this question, there are several factors to consider when coming up with a decision. First, AAVE has a strong team of experienced developers who have demonstrated their ability to execute on their roadmap. Second, AAVE has been growing rapidly, with lending volumes increasing tenfold in the past year. Finally, AAVE is supported by a number of major cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets, which adds to its liquidity and stability. Overall, AAVE appears to be a strong project with a lot of upside potential. However, as with any investment, it is important to do your own research before deciding whether or not to invest. Many people have this question on their minds as the stock prices of this company continue to rise. Aave is a financial services company that offers online banking, loans, and other financial products. Founded in 2017, the company has seen rapid growth in recent years. In 2020, Aave launched its first product, a lending platform that allows users to borrow money from other users. The platform has been very successful, and Aave has since expanded into other areas, such as savings and investments. With its strong product offering and growing customer base, there is no reason why Aave cannot continue to expand at a rapid pace. As such, it is quite possible that the token’s average price will continue to rise, potentially reaching $1000 in the future, especially taking into account its past performance: the token hit its highest price level of $666 in May 2021. None of the content on Changelly, including the AAVE price forecast, is investment advice, nor is it a replacement of advice from a certified financial planner.

Title: Cash, not crypto remains criminal's preferred tool for illicit finance, study says
Date: October 3, 2024 at 10:53 am
Content:

Share  Despite widespread misconceptions, cash remains the dominant tool for illicit finance, while blockchain offers greater transparency and traceability, a new study reveals. Cash remains the preferred tool for criminals engaging in illicit finance, despite the popular perception that cryptocurrencies dominate unlawful transactions, a new study by Crypto ISAC reveals. While blockchain transactions create an immutable record, making crypto more traceable, cash transactions leave no digital footprint, complicating efforts to track illicit activities. “The scale of money laundering and terrorist financing through conventional banking channels, as reported by regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies, dwarfs the volume of similar activities observed in the cryptocurrency space.” Crypto ISAC Though cryptocurrencies have been tied to crime in high-profile cases, including exchange collapses and thefts, these account for a small portion of total crypto volume. Crypto ISAC notes that while it is impossible to track the exact amount of illicit activity in the traditional finance space, the estimated amount of money laundered globally in one year is 2-5% of global GDP, or $800 billion-$2 trillion. Meanwhile, blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis reported that in 2023, just 0.34% of on-chain transaction volume was linked to illicit activity. Crypto ISAC noted that law enforcement agencies have increasingly used blockchain’s transparency to track illegal activity, positioning regulated crypto platforms as allies in combating crime. At the same time, when criminals use traditional finance systems, there are no public sources through which law enforcement can easily trace funds, which makes it harder for law enforcement agencies to track down criminals. “This creates a higher burden of proof and requires the U.S. Attorney to empanel and jury to hear and issue the subpoena. Only then can law enforcement begin to piece together the forensic trail of the funds at issue.” Crypto ISAC The U.S. Treasury earlier also echoed these findings, stating that cash continues to be the go-to method for money laundering because of its anonymity, stability, and ubiquity. According to the Treasury’s February reports, bulk cash smuggling, often involving U.S. dollar banknotes transported across borders and deposited into foreign accounts, remains a common method for laundering illicit proceeds.

Title: Crypto Tax Payments Get Few Takers as More States Eye Programs
Date: Date not available
Content:
 Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.  Americas+1 212 318 2000  EMEA+44 20 7330 7500  Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000   Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.  Americas+1 212 318 2000  EMEA+44 20 7330 7500  Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000  By Michael J. Bologna In the two years since Colorado became the first state to accept cryptocurrency for payment of taxes, it hasn’t collected enough revenue to cover the cost of a single Bitcoin. Utah, the only other state to accept digital currency for taxes, hasn’t received any payments at all. Despite taxpayers’ general lack of enthusiasm for digital currency as a payment method, policy makers in a handful of states are lining up to follow Colorado and Utah. Arizona came close this year to passing a bill, S.B. 1128, directing the state to accept cryptocurrencies for payment of taxes, fines, and fees. An Ohio lawmaker introduced similar legislation, S.B. 317, last month. And Louisiana’s treasurer just announced the state would accept cryptocurrency as payment for certain state services, highlighting one resident’s crypto payment of a $50 civil fine to the state Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.  “If we want to encourage innovation and free enterprise in Ohio, we should do everything we can to normalize the use of cryptocurrencies,” said state Sen. Niraj Antani (R), sponsor of the bill in that state. “By allowing Ohioans to pay their taxes and fees with cryptocurrency, we will be on the cutting edge.” Antani isn’t running for re-election and lost a primary bid for a seat in Congress. Some of the new interest can be traced to the recent surge in the price of Bitcoin, which has traded between $55,000 and $71,000 over the last six months. This higher and more stable price range followed a period of “crypto winter” when token prices hovered around $25,000 for much of 2022 and 2023. If the current trend continues, more states may adopt crypto as a payment method, said Miles Fuller, senior director of government solutions at the cryptocurrency tax compliance company TaxBit. Skeptics, however, say Colorado and Utah are examples of states trying to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. Digital currencies might be interesting, but they offer no practical solutions to any payment problems taxpayers and state revenue departments currently encounter. “I just don’t understand why states want to do this other than the fact it may look ‘cool,’ ” said Omri Marian, a professor of tax law at the University of California Irvine School of Law. “It makes no policy sense. It’s an added collection cost to the state with no discernible benefit.” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) made a big splash in September 2022 when he launched the state’s cryptocurrency program, but taxpayers barely noticed. The state Department of Revenue has accepted 72 tax payments in digital currencies in the last two years, totaling $56,510. There has been a gentle increase in participation: The state processed eight cryptocurrency payments in 2022, 22 in 2023, and 42 so far in 2024. That’s out of more than 3.2 million individual income tax returns and more than 61,000 corporate returns the department processes each year. In 2023 the state had net personal income tax collections of $10.2 billion and corporate tax collections of $1.28 billion. A spokesperson with the Utah State Tax Commission said it has not received any cryptocurrency payments.. Taxpayers’ reluctance can be tied, at least in part, to costs layered on top of each transaction, Fuller said. Colorado and Utah don’t recognize crypto as legal tender and can’t accept digital currency directly, so their revenue agencies have contracted with third parties to broker each transaction and immediately convert digital currencies into US dollars. That means paying in crypto comes at a price to taxpayers, with the payment processor assessing a fee. Coloradoand Utah, for example, use PayPal, which charges a service fee of $1 per transaction, plus 1.83% of the payment amount. “Essentially there is an economic disincentive for a taxpayer to use that payment route,” Fuller said. “If you’ve got Bitcoin, you’re probably better off selling it on Kraken or Gemini with lower fees and transmitting the cash to the government.” Fees aside, taxpayers with substantial positions in crypto may want to avoid tax transactions that turn into taxable events, said Andrew Appleby, a professor of tax law at Stetson University College of Law in Florida. “When a taxpayer uses cryptocurrency to pay a tax liability, that transaction will generally constitute a disposition of an intangible asset, which itself creates a new taxable transaction,” Appleby said. “If a taxpayer acquired a Bitcoin for $40k and subsequently transferred it to a state taxing agency for $55k, the taxpayer would have a $15k gain on that transaction.” State legislators have demonstrated a strong interest in cryptocurrency, although mostly not in relation to taxes. Hundreds of bills have been introduced in three dozen states since 2022, ranging from consumer protection measures to tax incentives supporting the development of blockchain technologies. A handful of the bills have dealt with tax administration issues, said Chelsea Canada, an analyst at the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures. The high-water mark for legislation that would allow revenue agencies to accept digital currencies as payment came in 2022. After Colorado and Utah enacted their laws, lawmakers in Arizona, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, New York, and Oklahoma considered bills, but didn’t take final action. In the last two years, Florida, Kansas, and New Hampshire have also considered these types of bills, Canada said. Despite this track record, the idea could get some traction in a handful of state legislatures next year in response to a bullish vibe flowing through the industry, Fuller said.  State revenue agencies have generally adapted to new payment models in response to taxpayer demands, Fuller said. Adoption of crypto could come quicker, he added, if the industry and revenue agencies found ways to reduce transaction costs. Appleby predicted some states would follow Colorado and Utah to demonstrate their receptiveness to a new and attractive business model. Colorado’s program was spurred in part by Polis’s personal enthusiasm for blockchain technology.  “States may want to signal a crypto-asset-friendly regulatory environment to incentivize crypto-asset businesses to migrate to the state,” he said.

Title: Tron price forms a bearish flag as SunPump meme coins crash
Date: October 3, 2024 at 2:15 pm
Content:

Share  Justin Sun’s Tron token is in a tight range as the ongoing crypto sell-off continues, with Bitcoin falling below $60,000. Tron (TRX) was trading at $0.1542, just a few points below its highest level this week. According to CoinGecko, it is the ninth-biggest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $13.3 billion. TRX has outperformed other top ten cryptocurrencies in the last seven days as it rose by 0.97%. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) have retreated by 6.2%, 10.6%, and 10.5% in the same period. Tron’s ecosystem is not doing well, with most meme coins in the recently launched SunPump ecosystem falling by double-digits. Sundog (SUNDOG), the biggest token in the ecosystem, has dropped by nearly 30% in the last seven days. Similarly, Tron Bull Coin, Muncat, Suncat, and Vikita have fallen by more than 30% in the same period. The only SunPump meme coins doing well were Tron Bull and Tron Beer, which have jumped by over 16% and 40%.  Other parts of the Tron ecosystem are not doing well. For example, the total value locked in its DeFi ecosystem has dropped by 6.8% in the last 30 days to $7.6 billion, making it the second-biggest network after Ethereum.  Tron’s DEX volume has also moved to $425 million, making it the 9th biggest player in the industry. It has been passed by newer chains like Sui and Base, which handled $700 million and $4.5 billion in the last seven days.  Still, Tron has many positives. It has become the market leader in the stablecoin payment industry. Data by TronScan shows that its Tether transactions rose by 9.75% on Oct. 2 to $70 billion.  Tron is also the most profitable chains in the crypto industry, with over $1.37 billion in fees this year. Its third-quarter revenue rose to $577 million, higher than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Tron rose to a record high of $0.1690 on Aug. 26, and has dropped by 8.83%. It has remained above the 50-day and 25-day Exponential Moving Averages, meaning that bulls are in control for now. However, signs indicate that it has formed a bearish flag chart pattern, a popular risky sign. If this pattern works out, Tron will likely slip to the key support at $0.1450, the highest swing in February this year.

Date: Date not available
Content:
The cryptocurrency landscape is dynamic and rapidly evolving, and here, opportunities abound for investors willing to dig deep. While established coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum often dominate discussions, several undervalued coins could offer remarkable potential for growth.

Before diving into specific coins, grasping the concept of undervalued cryptocurrencies is essential. These digital assets trade below their intrinsic value due to market fluctuations, lack of awareness, or mispricing. Identifying such coins requires careful analysis of their fundamentals, technology, and market trends. Investing in undervalued cryptocurrencies can yield substantial profits when their true potential is recognized, making it a critical strategy for savvy investors. Investors can uncover hidden gems in the crypto world by focusing on emerging technologies, strong communities, and unique use cases.

As AR and VR technologies evolve, 5thScape stands out as a promising investment opportunity in the gaming sector. Its innovative approach and strong community support position it well for future success, making it a compelling choice for investors seeking to capitalize on the next wave of digital experiences. The Graph is a decentralized indexing protocol designed to simplify data access for blockchain developers. It allows users to query data from various blockchains, including Ethereum and IPFS, through a user-friendly GraphQL interface. As decentralized applications (dApps) proliferate, the importance of The Graph as a data aggregator cannot be overstated. The Graph operates on a unique ecosystem where developers can create and publish subgraphs, enabling efficient data retrieval for their dApps. Its decentralized nature means that developers and users are not reliant on centralized services, ensuring transparency and security. Despite its critical role in the blockchain ecosystem, GRT has experienced price volatility that may not accurately reflect its utility. With increasing projects relying on The Graph for data indexing, the demand for GRT is poised to grow. Investors can expect The Graph to appreciate significantly as the DeFi and Web3 landscapes continue to expand. The Graph presents a compelling investment opportunity for those looking to tap into the growing demand for decentralized data solutions. With its strong utility, increasing adoption, and a clear path for growth, GRT is a dark horse worth considering. Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform designed to provide fast and low-cost transactions. It utilizes a unique proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism, enabling it to process thousands of transactions per second. This capability positions Solana as a viable alternative to Ethereum for dApp development. Solana’s speed and scalability make it particularly attractive for various applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming. Its growing ecosystem includes popular projects like Serum and Mango Markets, which leverage Solana’s capabilities to offer users enhanced experiences. While Solana has faced challenges, including network outages and scalability concerns, its fundamentals remain strong. The project has actively addressed these issues and continues to attract developers and investors. As the demand for fast and efficient blockchains increases, Solana is well-positioned for future growth. Despite some hurdles, Solana’s high-performance features and expanding ecosystem make it a strong contender for investors seeking undervalued cryptocurrencies. With its potential to capture market share from Ethereum and its focus on scalability, SOL is an investment worth considering. Polygon, formerly known as Matic Network, is a layer-2 scaling solution designed to enhance Ethereum’s capabilities. By providing a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, Polygon addresses Ethereum’s scalability issues and high transaction fees. Polygon’s architecture enables developers to create and deploy their own blockchains while benefiting from Ethereum’s security and ecosystem. This scalability and interoperability make Polygon an attractive choice for developers looking to build decentralized applications without the constraints of Ethereum’s current limitations. Despite experiencing fluctuations in its price, MATIC remains undervalued given its utility and potential. The increasing number of projects integrating with Polygon signals strong market demand. As Ethereum’s transaction volumes continue to grow, Polygon’s role as a scaling solution will likely become even more crucial, enhancing MATIC’s value proposition. Polygon’s innovative approach to scalability and interoperability makes it a dark horse investment with substantial growth potential. With the ongoing expansion of the Ethereum ecosystem and the need for efficient solutions, MATIC is well-positioned for long-term success. Cardano is a blockchain platform that takes a scientific approach to development, emphasizing security and sustainability. Its unique Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus algorithm is designed to be energy-efficient while ensuring a secure and scalable network. Cardano has made significant strides recently, including the launch of smart contracts and the expansion of its DeFi ecosystem. These developments position Cardano as a strong contender in the blockchain space, attracting attention from developers and investors alike. While Cardano has faced criticism for its slower development pace compared to competitors, its methodical approach and strong community support cannot be overlooked. The ADA token remains undervalued given its foundational technology and potential for widespread adoption. Cardano is poised for a potential breakout as more projects build on its platform. Cardano’s commitment to security and sustainability, coupled with recent technological advancements, positions it as a dark horse investment in the crypto space. ADA could see significant appreciation as the ecosystem grows, making it a worthwhile addition to any investment portfolio. Investors should always conduct comprehensive research before diving into any cryptocurrency. This includes understanding the technology behind the coin, its use case, the team behind the project, and its market positioning. 5thScape delivers a clear roadmap with its 4-phased launch map that makes it a credible project to invest in. Keeping an eye on market trends and sentiment can provide valuable insights into potential price movements. Social media platforms, forums, and news articles can offer a pulse on community sentiment, helping investors make informed decisions. Investing in multiple undervalued cryptocurrencies can mitigate risk. By diversifying across various projects, investors can reduce their exposure to volatility and increase their chances of capitalizing on emerging trends. Cryptocurrency investments often require a long-term perspective. While some coins may experience short-term price fluctuations, patience can be a virtue in waiting for a project’s true value to be recognized. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, undervalued coins like 5thScape, The Graph, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano present compelling investment opportunities. By understanding the unique value propositions of these projects and applying sound investment strategies, investors can position themselves for potential success in this ever-evolving landscape. 5thScape, the unique AR and VR project leading our list, stands out from the other contenders in the market due to its unique selling proposition. These dark horse cryptocurrencies may become the stars of the next crypto bull run by focusing on innovative technologies, strong communities, and sustainable growth models.

Title: IntelMarkets Set to Lead Next Crypto Bull Run, Surpassing DOGE & BCH
Date: Last updated: 10 hours ago
Content:
Written By:Press Release Based on historical data, analysts believe the next crypto bull run could occur anytime from now. Meanwhile, analysts believe a newcomer, IntelMarkets, will lead the next crypto bull market based on its unique offering, which has stolen the attention of investors. On the other hand, top crypto coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) could rise higher. Still, analysts say IntelMarkets has a higher potential for growth. In a recent tweet, crypto analyst Ali Martinez called the attention of the cryptocurrency community to a rise in activity on the Dogecoin network. According to quoting data from Santiment, Martinez said the number of new addresses has increased by 72% over the past week. The analyst also said that 19,630 addresses were created on September 30th alone. This rise in new addresses could increase investor interest, which could affect the Dogecoin price. Presently, the cryptocurrency is trading around the $0.1 region. It is trading between 50-SMA ($0.105653) and 200-SMA ($0.123715). LLuciano_BTC says that the value of Dogecoin crypto could pump to $0.2400 during the next bull run. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is among the altcoins that are trading in the red region. Its price has dropped by 8% on the weekly chart and 1.9% on the monthly level. In terms of price movement, Bitcoin Cash coin is consolidating between $280 and $360 on the monthly timeframe. Due to the bearish sentiment, it has lost two previous supports at the 50-SMA ($335.29) and 200-SMA ($375.49) marks. Despite the bearish sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency, analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin Cash price future movement. ProfitRealm0 says that the value of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) could rally to $1,000 during the bull run. Amdtrades forecast the value of Bitcoin Cash crypto could pump to $1,167 in the coming months. IntelMarkets is gradually becoming the leader in the crypto trading arena. Its presale, which is now in stage three, has been a massive success. The project is closer to reaching $1 million in funding, with its current figure at $907k. Analysts expect IntelMarkets’s INTL to increase by 10x from its price of $0.027364 in the coming bull season. IntelMarkets has a dual-chain structure which gives users a connection to a large number of liquidity sources and different DeFi services. It means that users can switch back and forth between networks – Solana and Ethereum, if necessary. This level of flexibility cannot be found in any other platform, according to experts. IntelMarkets has achieved new heights with the help of tools such as AI algorithms and risk management systems, thus helping small traders face institutional investors. For instance, it has a feature that allows new users to copy the experts and earn profits. Additionally, the self-learning AI bots, which are a part of IntelMarkets, control and maintain users’ portfolios and assist them in enhancing their earnings through analysis of traders’ behavior and trade patterns. These are bots that provide trading services that mimic real-time market changes in order to provide the best results possible. As IntelMarkets keeps growing, it will overtake famous names such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in the near future. As the next bull market approaches, INTL is preparing itself to become one of the top gainers, making it a must-have for investors who want to jump on the next wave of the cryptocurrency bull season.

Title: Bitcoin dumps as Biden supports Israel hitting Iran oil facilities
Date: October 3, 2024 at 3:32 pm
Content:

Share  Bitcoin and altcoins continued their downward trend while crude oil prices jumped as the odds of a wider crisis in the Middle East rose. Bitcoin (BTC) retreated below $60,000 for the first time since Sep. 16 after Joe Biden hinted that he would support Israel hitting Iranian oil facilities, per Barrons. Other altcoins, like Ethena (ENA), Conflux (CFX), and Beam (BEAM), tumbled by over 15%, making them the worst performers in the top 100. Meanwhile, crude oil bounced back, with Brent and West Texas Intermediate surging by over 4% to $76.5 and $73, respectively. American indices like the Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 reversed earlier gains and dropped by over 50 bps.  Biden’s statement raises the stakes for a wider conflict in the Middle East. A report by the New York Times cited senior Israeli officials who said that the country was prepared to go to war with Iran. Polymarket traders see a 63% chance that Israel will attack Iranian oil this month.  A prolonged war in the Middle East would have a major impact across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. It would increase oil and gas prices because Iran exports over 1.3 million barrels a day. Also, because of the Red Sea’s importance in the shipping industry, it would lead to supply chain interruptions. Higher inflation would then impact the ongoing interest rate cycle by the Federal Reserve and other central banks. The geopolitically-driven move up in oil prices continues today (Bloomberg chart below). Interestingly, the behavior of some other market prices signals somewhat greater concerns about possible price spillover effects/passthroughs. #economy #markets #oil #econtwitter pic.twitter.com/7pDTdJ0xnl In a recent note, three Blackrock analysts wrote that Bitcoin holds better than other assets in periods of geopolitical issues. They cited six major events, including the US and Iran escalation, the COVID outbreak, 2020 US election challenge, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, US banking crisis, and the yen carry trade unwinding. In all these events, Bitcoin did better than the S&P 500 index and gold in a 60-day period.  Blackrock also noted that Bitcoin had more potential catalysts that could push it higher in the long term. The most notable ones were the US debt dynamics, its long track record of outperformance, its uncorrelated asset status, and its 21 million supply cap.

Title: MoonPay Supports PayPal Stablecoin For Crypto Purchases - FinanceFeeds
Date: October 3, 2024
Content:
MoonPay has expanded its services to include PayPal USD (PYUSD), the dollar-denominated stablecoin issued by Paxos Trust Company. Users in all supported countries, excluding Canada, can now buy PYUSD through MoonPay using major payment methods. This support follows the strategic integration between MoonPay and PayPal, announced in May 2024, which enabled MoonPay users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies using their PayPal accounts. The integration is said to address issues related to declined crypto purchases via debit card, with MoonPay asserting that it will improve the success rate of crypto transactions, even when using the same debit card. Furthermore, existing PayPal users will no longer need to manually input their card information when buying cryptocurrencies on MoonPay. According to the press release, MoonPay users will not be limited to PayPal purchases solely with the PYUSD stablecoin or ether. Instead, they will have the flexibility to buy and sell more than 110 coins and tokens. Roughly half of MoonPay’s customers in the U.S. are expected to benefit from this integration. Moreover, the company plans to extend its PayPal integration to users in the United Kingdom and the European Union in the near future. MoonPay claims to be the first provider to integrate with PayPal for both on and off-ramp services, highlighting the integration’s availability to users on all of MoonPay’s partner platforms. This sets MoonPay apart from a crypto exchange with PayPal integration, like Coinbase. PYUSD, backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and cash equivalents, is one of the first consumer-facing stablecoins launched by a major financial services firm. PayPal has actively sought to expand its presence in the digital assets market, recently announcing plans to allow U.S. business customers to buy, sell, hold, and transfer cryptocurrencies. Although PYUSD’s market capitalization hit $1 billion in August, it has since decreased to around $705 million. Despite initially surpassing Ethereum in PYUSD supply on Solana, the Solana-based supply has since dropped below Ethereum’s.

Title: Crypto Tax Payments Get Few Takers as More States Eye Programs

Americas+1 212 318 2000  EMEA+44 20 7330 7500  Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000  By Michael J. Bologna In the two years since Colorado became the first state to accept cryptocurrency for payment of taxes, it hasn’t collected enough revenue to cover the cost of a single Bitcoin. Utah, the only other state to accept digital currency for taxes, hasn’t received any payments at all. Despite taxpayers’ general lack of enthusiasm for digital currency as a payment method, policy makers in a handful of states are lining up to follow Colorado and Utah. Arizona came close this year to passing a bill, S.B. 1128, directing the state to accept cryptocurrencies for payment of taxes, fines, and fees. An Ohio lawmaker introduced similar legislation, S.B. 317, last month. And Louisiana’s treasurer just announced the state would accept cryptocurrency as payment for certain state services, highlighting one resident’s crypto payment of a $50 civil fine to the state Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.  “If we want to encourage innovation and free enterprise in Ohio, we should do everything we can to normalize the use of cryptocurrencies,” said state Sen. Niraj Antani (R), sponsor of the bill in that state. “By allowing Ohioans to pay their taxes and fees with cryptocurrency, we will be on the cutting edge.” Antani isn’t running for re-election and lost a primary bid for a seat in Congress. Some of the new interest can be traced to the recent surge in the price of Bitcoin, which has traded between $55,000 and $71,000 over the last six months. This higher and more stable price range followed a period of “crypto winter” when token prices hovered around $25,000 for much of 2022 and 2023. If the current trend continues, more states may adopt crypto as a payment method, said Miles Fuller, senior director of government solutions at the cryptocurrency tax compliance company TaxBit. Skeptics, however, say Colorado and Utah are examples of states trying to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. Digital currencies might be interesting, but they offer no practical solutions to any payment problems taxpayers and state revenue departments currently encounter. “I just don’t understand why states want to do this other than the fact it may look ‘cool,’ ” said Omri Marian, a professor of tax law at the University of California Irvine School of Law. “It makes no policy sense. It’s an added collection cost to the state with no discernible benefit.” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) made a big splash in September 2022 when he launched the state’s cryptocurrency program, but taxpayers barely noticed. The state Department of Revenue has accepted 72 tax payments in digital currencies in the last two years, totaling $56,510. There has been a gentle increase in participation: The state processed eight cryptocurrency payments in 2022, 22 in 2023, and 42 so far in 2024. That’s out of more than 3.2 million individual income tax returns and more than 61,000 corporate returns the department processes each year. In 2023 the state had net personal income tax collections of $10.2 billion and corporate tax collections of $1.28 billion. A spokesperson with the Utah State Tax Commission said it has not received any cryptocurrency payments.. Taxpayers’ reluctance can be tied, at least in part, to costs layered on top of each transaction, Fuller said. Colorado and Utah don’t recognize crypto as legal tender and can’t accept digital currency directly, so their revenue agencies have contracted with third parties to broker each transaction and immediately convert digital currencies into US dollars. That means paying in crypto comes at a price to taxpayers, with the payment processor assessing a fee. Coloradoand Utah, for example, use PayPal, which charges a service fee of $1 per transaction, plus 1.83% of the payment amount. “Essentially there is an economic disincentive for a taxpayer to use that payment route,” Fuller said. “If you’ve got Bitcoin, you’re probably better off selling it on Kraken or Gemini with lower fees and transmitting the cash to the government.” Fees aside, taxpayers with substantial positions in crypto may want to avoid tax transactions that turn into taxable events, said Andrew Appleby, a professor of tax law at Stetson University College of Law in Florida. “When a taxpayer uses cryptocurrency to pay a tax liability, that transaction will generally constitute a disposition of an intangible asset, which itself creates a new taxable transaction,” Appleby said. “If a taxpayer acquired a Bitcoin for $40k and subsequently transferred it to a state taxing agency for $55k, the taxpayer would have a $15k gain on that transaction.” State legislators have demonstrated a strong interest in cryptocurrency, although mostly not in relation to taxes. Hundreds of bills have been introduced in three dozen states since 2022, ranging from consumer protection measures to tax incentives supporting the development of blockchain technologies. A handful of the bills have dealt with tax administration issues, said Chelsea Canada, an analyst at the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures. The high-water mark for legislation that would allow revenue agencies to accept digital currencies as payment came in 2022. After Colorado and Utah enacted their laws, lawmakers in Arizona, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, New York, and Oklahoma considered bills, but didn’t take final action. In the last two years, Florida, Kansas, and New Hampshire have also considered these types of bills, Canada said. Despite this track record, the idea could get some traction in a handful of state legislatures next year in response to a bullish vibe flowing through the industry, Fuller said.  State revenue agencies have generally adapted to new payment models in response to taxpayer demands, Fuller said. Adoption of crypto could come quicker, he added, if the industry and revenue agencies found ways to reduce transaction costs. Appleby predicted some states would follow Colorado and Utah to demonstrate their receptiveness to a new and attractive business model. Colorado’s program was spurred in part by Polis’s personal enthusiasm for blockchain technology.  “States may want to signal a crypto-asset-friendly regulatory environment to incentivize crypto-asset businesses to migrate to the state,” he said.

Title: Crypto market liquidates $272 million in 24 hours as Bitcoin drops to $60k
Date: Date not available
Content:
Bitcoin reenters lower trading channel for first time since mid September as traders liquidated. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s recent price movements have shown increased volatility, with $272 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours, reflecting broader market trends and trader behavior. Over the past 48 hours, Bitcoin fell from $62,000 to a low of $60,000, marking a roughly 3% decline. Following this drop, Bitcoin saw a slight recovery to $61,400 before retesting $60,000 again this morning amid the market’s ongoing uncertainty. Coinglass liquidation data indicates significant long liquidations in the same period, with $221 million in positions cleared in the past 24 hours alone. This suggests traders faced pressure as the market briefly trended downward. Per Coinglass, 95,621 traders were liquidated during this period, with Binance witnessing the most significant single liquidation—an ETHUSDT order worth $12.24 million. Exchange-specific data shows Binance accounting for $30.72 million of the $48.35 million in total liquidations within the last 4 hours, with longs making up the majority at 95.58%. OKX and Bybit followed, contributing $8.78 million and $5 million, respectively. Ethereum led in asset liquidations at $67.95 million, followed by Bitcoin at $57.65 million. The concentrated long liquidation points to sentiment misalignment as traders were overly bullish amid fluctuating market conditions and global geopolitical instability. As price action stabilizes near $60,000, the market remains sensitive to short-term fluctuations and macroeconomic factors. The market is again testing the bottom of a channel seen repeatedly throughout 2024. As CryptoSlate identified earlier in the year, Bitcoin has traded between several key areas notably, $71,500 to $68,000 (yellow), $66,900 to $61,800 (white), $60,400 to $56,600 (red), and $55,700 to $49,700 (blue). Bitcoin has reentered the red channel for the fifth time in 2024. On just three occasions, it continued down into the blue channel before recovering into the white channel. Should Bitcoin stabilize within the red channel, the bottom support has been around $56,600. Notably, the channels align most accurately with the 30-minute timeframe. At the time of press 10:02 am UTC on Oct. 3, 2024, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is down 2.54% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $1.19 trillion with a 24-hour trading volume of $41.45 billion.

Our #1 AI Stock Pick is on a steep discount - 29$ instead of 99$! Click here to access exclusive research! Bitcoin may have led the charge in online gambling, but a new wave of altcoins is transforming the space even further. Altcoins—such as Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Ripple—are gaining significant attention in crypto casinos, each offering unique features like enhanced speed, affordability, and better scalability. Altcoins are simply alternative cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin, offering different solutions and opportunities. While Bitcoin focuses mainly on decentralization and security, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) excel with smart contracts, allowing for decentralized applications that redefine gambling experiences. Litecoin (LTC) provides faster and cheaper transactions compared to Bitcoin, which is particularly attractive to gamblers who don’t want long wait times for deposits or withdrawals. Dogecoin (DOGE) started as a meme but gained real value as a fast, community-supported currency. Ripple (XRP), known for its speed and cost-effectiveness in cross-border transactions, also stands out for casino use, providing a different dynamic than more volatile altcoins. Altcoins are increasingly featured in USA bitcoin casinos for several key reasons: • Transaction Speed: Bitcoin transactions, especially during peak times, can be slow. In contrast, altcoins like Litecoin and Ripple offer near-instantaneous payments, reducing the time players need to wait for deposits or withdrawals to be processed. This immediacy is a crucial aspect of the gambling experience, where players want fast access to their funds. • Lower Transaction Costs: Compared to Bitcoin’s often high transaction fees, altcoins generally come with lower costs. This is especially beneficial to casual players who want to avoid paying large fees relative to their stakes. Dogecoin, for instance, is known for minimal transaction costs, making it an affordable option for frequent, smaller transactions. • Scalability: Bitcoin faces scalability issues that altcoins like Ethereum aim to solve. Ethereum’s network allows for the deployment of smart contracts, which creates unique opportunities for gambling operators. Smart contracts ensure trustless environments, meaning games can be more transparent and secure, with all bets and payouts being recorded immutably on the blockchain. Different altcoins bring unique attributes to the table, enhancing how crypto casinos operate and provide services. Here is a look at some of the most popular altcoins used in crypto gambling: • Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is favored for its capability to create decentralized applications (DApps) using smart contracts. These features have enabled the creation of trustless gambling platforms, where all processes—from placing a bet to payout—are automated. This decentralized model eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary, enhancing transparency. • Litecoin (LTC): Often called the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” Litecoin provides similar features but at a significantly faster rate and with cheaper fees. Litecoin has been widely adopted by crypto casinos looking to attract users who want a simpler, cheaper, and quicker experience than Bitcoin. • Dogecoin (DOGE): Despite starting as a joke, Dogecoin has found a solid place in the online gambling community. Its wide circulation, low value, and negligible transaction fees make it perfect for casual gambling. Dogecoin’s community backing has also contributed to its steady adoption in various gambling environments. • Ripple (XRP): Ripple’s value lies in its speed and low-cost cross-border payment system. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Ripple was designed to facilitate faster transactions between financial institutions, making it an ideal altcoin for transferring funds quickly to and from casino platforms. While Bitcoin remains the most well-known and accepted cryptocurrency in online casinos, altcoins present several advantages that set them apart: • Enhanced Privacy: Some altcoins, such as Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC), offer greater anonymity compared to Bitcoin. For players who value privacy and wish to keep their activities entirely untraceable, these privacy-focused altcoins are an excellent option. The cryptographic methods used by these coins hide transaction details, ensuring an added layer of security. • Diverse Betting Opportunities: Using multiple altcoins allows players to diversify their crypto holdings. For example, while one altcoin may provide better value during particular periods due to lower fees or faster transactions, others could offer incentives or bonuses tied to a specific cryptocurrency. • Low Network Fees and Fast Confirmations: Bitcoin’s network fees can become expensive, especially during peak times. Litecoin, Ripple, and Dogecoin consistently offer lower network fees, making them more attractive to players who don’t want the fee to take a significant percentage of their winnings. Additionally, these altcoins process transactions much faster, which is crucial for gamblers looking for immediate access to their funds. Despite their numerous benefits, altcoins are not without challenges: • Volatility: All cryptocurrencies are volatile, but altcoins can often exhibit greater fluctuations compared to Bitcoin. This volatility can impact a player’s overall funds, particularly if they need to convert altcoin winnings to fiat currency during a market downturn. • Adoption Rates: While Bitcoin is universally accepted at most crypto casinos, altcoin adoption varies. Some casinos may only accept a limited selection of altcoins, restricting player choices. However, leading platforms such as those featured on HARO-recommended sites like Bitcoin-Casino.us have started offering a wide range of altcoin options to attract a broader audience and provide players with more flexibility. • Complexity for New Users: Navigating between different cryptocurrencies and wallets can be challenging for newcomers. Learning how to use each altcoin, manage wallets, and understand transaction processes requires some degree of technical knowledge. To make the most of your experience in crypto casinos using altcoins, consider these strategic tips: • Take Advantage of Altcoin Bonuses: Many crypto casinos offer exclusive bonuses for deposits made with specific altcoins. These promotions often provide better terms compared to Bitcoin bonuses, such as lower wagering requirements or higher matching percentages. Always check the terms and conditions and capitalize on these offers to increase your bankroll. • Understand Each Altcoin’s Specific Benefits: Every altcoin has unique attributes. Ethereum, with its smart contract functionality, may be the ideal choice for decentralized gaming environments, whereas Litecoin could be preferable for players seeking fast and inexpensive transactions. Choose the altcoin that aligns with your playing style and goals. • Stay Informed About Market Trends: Cryptocurrency values fluctuate frequently, and the value of an altcoin can have a significant effect on your gambling strategy. Keeping an eye on market trends will help you decide the best time to cash out winnings or make a deposit. The future looks promising for altcoins in the online gambling industry. As the blockchain space continues to grow, more altcoins are likely to be developed with features specifically tailored to gambling, such as faster transaction confirmations, lower fees, and enhanced privacy measures. Platforms are also becoming more inclusive of different altcoins to cater to diverse player preferences. Moreover, smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) are expected to have a huge impact on how gambling platforms operate, enabling more transparent, fair, and decentralized systems. The integration of altcoins in these platforms ensures a broader, more flexible user experience, ultimately enhancing the fairness and functionality of online casinos. While Bitcoin remains the pioneer in the world of crypto gambling, altcoins are increasingly proving themselves to be valuable alternatives. From the fast transactions of Litecoin to the smart contract capabilities of Ethereum, altcoins bring a diverse range of features that enhance the overall gambling experience. Using altcoins in crypto casinos can mean better privacy, lower costs, and faster access to funds—factors that are vital for a seamless gaming experience.

Title: Credbull and Plume to launch new RWA liquid solutions Liquidstone
Date: October 3, 2024 at 1:01 pm
Content:

Share  On-chain private credit platform Credbulll partners with Plume to launch LiquidStone, new liquid high yield solutions offered only on the Plume Network’s platform. According to Credbull’s release, LiquidStone’s asset structure will be diversified across on-chain liquid assets, collateralized on-chain lending and high yielding trade financing solutions. For the first phase of the launch, Credbull will begin the expansion with an asset capacity of $100 million as well as a 30-day 10% annual percentage yield product accompanied by redemption features. The initial launch is then followed by another rollout in the first quarter of 2025, with a 90-Day 15% APY product with monthly APY distribution, ultimately expanding the asset capacity to $500 million. LiquidStone is built upon Credbull, Plume and Centrifuge’s initial plans to integrate more premium assets into the Plume ecosystem. CEO of Credbull Jason Dehni, the expansion reflects Credbull’s commitment to provide “innovative and high-quality private credit products to the DeFi space”. “By leveraging Plume’s network and its innovative approach to RWAfi, we offer our on-chain structured finance solutions with enhanced efficiency and accessibility,” said Dehni. Additionally, Credbull will also offer rewards specifically designed to suit’s Plume’s RWAfi ecosystem. Plume’s platform will serve as the exclusive venue for LiquidStone. CEO of Plume Network, Chris Yin, states that Plume’s ecosystem was made to accommodate RWAfi. The blockchain aims to simplify and enhance liquidity for the real world asset industry. “We are furthering our mission to drive innovation and efficiency in the DeFi space while supporting the broader adoption of on-chain funds through Centrifuge,” said Yin. In May 2024, Credbull’s Jason Dehni said in an interview with crypto.news that he believes RWA tokenization is a “transformative force”. He added that asset tokenization has the potential to significantly alter global economics, reduce economic disparity, and lower investment barriers. He also claims RWA can open the door to inaccessible assets, which would benefit people living in developing countries.

Title: Bitcoin Vs Ethereum: Which Crypto Will Hit New ATHs First? This Altcoin Could Be the Real Winner
Date: 3. October 2024
Content:
The battle between Bitcoin and Ethereum for reaching new all-time highs is heating up. While these two giants capture attention, another altcoin could surprise everyone. This piece delves into which cryptocurrencies are primed for a breakout. Insights on market trends and expert opinions promise to reveal which digital asset might soon lead the pack. CYBRO is capturing the attention of crypto whales as its exclusive token presale quickly surges above $2.8 million. This next-generation DeFi platform offers investors unparalleled opportunities to maximize their earnings in any market condition. Experts predict a potential ROI of 1200%, with CYBRO tokens available at a presale price of just $0.03 each. This rare, technologically advanced project has already attracted prominent crypto whales and influencers, indicating strong confidence and interest. In another exciting update, CYBRO has introduced a referral program. It offers 12% commissions from direct referees’ token purchases, 3% from second-level referees, and 2% from third-level referees. Rewards are distributed weekly in USDT, and referees receive double CYBRO Points on their first deposit using the referral code.  In addition to its token offering, CYBRO has introduced a Points system, further enhancing investor incentives. Holders of these Points will automatically qualify for participation in the CYBRO Airdrop, with token distribution tied directly to the number of Points held. The platform allocates up to 1 million Points on a weekly basis, which investors can accrue through positions in CYBRO’s DeFi Vaults. Holders of CYBRO tokens will enjoy lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, cashback on purchases, reduced trading and lending fees, and a robust insurance program within the platform.

This process, called mining, not only confirms transactions but also rewards miners with bitcoins. With a limit of 21 million bitcoins, its software reduces rewards over time, potentially influencing the market. As the original digital currency, Bitcoin paved the way for others and still plays a significant role in the crypto space. Its design could affect how digital money is perceived and used in transactions today. Ethereum is a standout among blockchains. It uses a system that lets people own parts of it, called Proof-of-Stake. This helps run its big playground of apps and digital money services. It lets people make deals without middlemen in place. Ethereum made a popular type of digital coin that is used for many things. You need its main coin, ETH, to pay for using the network. Since 2013, it has grown a lot, making big changes to handle more tasks and stay true to its open structure. Its main coin, Ether, keeps everything working. It fuels trades, rewards, and more. This crypto has shown strong patterns in the market, sparking talks of possible gains for altcoins. Both BTC and ETH are expected to grow in the upcoming bull run, but their short-term potential may be limited. In contrast, CYBRO stands out as a technologically advanced DeFi platform on the Blast blockchain. It maximizes earnings with AI-powered yield aggregation. The platform offers lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. CYBRO also ensures a seamless user experience with easy deposits and withdrawals.

Title: Finery Markets Adds RFQ Execution To Become First Hybrid Crypto ECN - FinanceFeeds
Date: October 3, 2024
Content:
Finery Markets has introduced a Request-for-Quote (RFQ) execution method to enhance its leading non-custodial crypto ECN for institutional clients. Complementing the existing order-book execution with firm quotes by global liquidity providers, the Request-for-Quote (RFQ) execution method establishes Finery Markets as the first hybrid crypto ECN. The Request For Quote (RFQ) mode allows a buyer to request a quote for a specific volume of an asset pair and then receive responses from multiple liquidity providers competing for the order. RFQ is particularly well-suited for large trades, as it helps minimize market impact, or for specific assets where continuous markets are unavailable. An RFQ, or Request for Quote, is a process used in financial markets where a buyer requests pricing information for a specific quantity of a financial instrument from multiple sellers. It is commonly used in bonds, options, and foreign exchange trading. By integrating both order-driven and quote-driven markets, Finery Markets now offers customers the flexibility to choose their preferred execution method. Finery Markets highlighted that, before launching the new hybrid mode ECN, the firm relocated its trading servers to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Japan. The goal was to position the servers closer to the crypto price discovery center, thereby enhancing the processing and analysis of market data. This way, clients gain a competitive edge while maintaining a secure and robust trading infrastructure.

Title: Crypto Traders Forecast 250% Growth For Popcat (POPCAT) By Q4 End: Two Other Altcoins That Can Produce Huge Returns » The Merkle News
Date: Date not available
Content:
  Although the crypto market has experienced some market fluctuations in recent months, many altcoins are back to life. This is supported by Stock Money Lizards, who see the current downtrend among altcoins as broken. The popular expert believes the next step is an uptrend. Among the cryptos traders keeping an eye on are Cutoshi, Popcat, and Neiro. While Popcat and Neiro are on an uptrend, Cutoshi’s performance in presale has surprised many with experts forecasting 500% rallies before its listing in exchanges like Uniswap and Binance. Find out more below. Cutoshi (CUTO) is challenging the status quo in the crypto market. This Ethereum-based meme coin seeks to displace popular cryptos like Popcat and Neiro based on growth potential. Having raised over $235k at its first presale stage, its next target is to reach $1M before October ends. The Cutoshi project draws inspiration from the Chinese Lucky Cat and the original teachings of the legendary Satoshi Nakamoto, which are privacy, freedom, and anonymity. As such, its main focus is on decentralization and wealth creation. Cutoshi’s aim is to create a community-driven ecosystem in which investors are given decision-making powers and control. The Cutoshi ecosystem boasts a Defi Hub, a learning academy, and a farming option. The multi-chain DEX exchange allows for cross-chain asset swapping, while the learning academy allows users to learn about cryptocurrencies, DeFi, and price charts on the platform. Through the farming option, users can participate in quests and win rewards and prizes. Unlike other meme coins, Cutoshi has a feasible roadmap and strategy, which it diligently follows. Experts project a 300% growth for $CUTO Token before it is listed on several DEX exchanges. Selling at $0.015, early buyers can position themselves to make maximum returns before the price sails to the moon. Popcat (POPCAT) has been hovering between the $0.904 and $1.01 price for some weeks. CoinMarketCap stats show a gain of 91% on the monthly time frame. If this current momentum continues, Popcat market cap could hit $1 billion before the month ends. Astute crypto advisor Crypto Jack has been monitoring the Popcat price chart. The expert observed that Popcat coin is breaking bullish from the present triangle pattern. As such, the analyst asked the over 351k followers on X to get ready for an explosive Popcat price surge this week. Moving ahead, the Popcat technical indicators look promising. Having recorded 17 green days in the past 30 days, the general market sentiment is bullish. While many traders project a 250% growth for Popcat before Q4 ends, Coincodex predicts a 228% rise in value in October. Neiro’s (NEIRO) current downtrend is a worry for many investors. However, data from Spot on-chain shows that many whales are accumulating Neiro tokens, which could rekindle investors’ interest in the dog-themed Ethereum-based meme coin. CoinMarketCap stats show that Neiro’s trading volume has dropped by over 20% in recent days. Crypto analyst Crypto Greek linked the recent fall of the Neiro coin to a whale who entered the project at an early stage and locked approximately $15M worth of the token while draining the market. However, the analyst maintained that Neiro is a good asset and expects the coin to recover soon. Despite Neiro’s gloomy outlook, the coin has gained over 380% in the YTD price metrics to rank among the top-performing cryptos. Coincodex Neiro’s price prediction is bullish with a positive 230% projection in the short term. As such, the present dip might be a great time to accumulate more Neiro coins. The outlook of many cryptocurrencies remains unclear, which has made investors exercise caution on crypto investment. For traders keen to triple their investment before Q4 ends, they may opt for Cutoshi, Neiro, and Popcat, which are showing signs of an imminent rally. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

In 2024, there are numerous methods that individuals can explore to accumulate crypto without spending any money. However, it is important to approach these opportunities with caution and a well-informed mindset. This guide outlines 10 effective ways to earn free crypto in 2024. Each method offers a unique approach to acquiring these digital assets, catering to different skill sets and preferences. From participating in airdrops and bounty campaigns to leveraging referral programs and completing microtasks, there are numerous avenues to explore. Table of Contents Airdrops have emerged as a popular concept in the cryptocurrency industry, serving the purpose of distributing free crypto tokens to users. Businesses and projects often utilize airdrops as a strategic ploy to grow their user base or gain a significant following for new cryptocurrencies. During an airdrop, businesses and developers distribute tokens to participants for various reasons. One of the primary motivations behind airdrops is to create awareness and attract attention to a particular crypto platform or project. By giving away free tokens, businesses are able to incentivize users to engage with their platform and gain familiarity with their product. Visit this page to learn about the most anticipated airdrops of 2024.  To participate in an airdrop, having a non-custodial crypto wallet is essential. This type of wallet allows users full control and ownership of their tokens, providing robust security measures and ensuring the privacy of their assets. Furthermore, it is important to have a crypto wallet that supports the blockchain of the given cryptocurrency, as some tokens may require compatibility with a specific network for transactional purposes. We compiled a list of the best crypto wallets for 2024 — click here to learn more. Crypto faucets are online platforms that provide users with small amounts of cryptocurrency in exchange for completing tasks. These tasks can vary from solving captchas to watching ads or playing games. The idea behind these faucets is to introduce users to the world of cryptocurrencies by giving them a taste of it while also generating some traffic to the faucet’s website. One of the key aspects to consider when using crypto faucets is the potential risk of scam faucets. Scam faucets may advertise generous rewards but fail to deliver when it comes to actually providing the promised cryptocurrency. To avoid falling victim to these scams, it is important to thoroughly research the legitimacy of a faucet before using it. Reading reviews, checking forums, and consulting reputable sources can help determine the credibility and reliability of a faucet. Additionally, some scam faucets may require users to provide personal information or even send some cryptocurrency as a “registration fee.” This is a major red flag, as legitimate faucets never ask users for personal information or any kind of payment.

One example of a browser with a search engine rewards program is Brave. Brave rewards users with a cryptocurrency called Basic Attention Token (BAT) for viewing privacy-respecting ads while browsing the web. Users have the option to see ads and receive BAT tokens, which can then be used to support content creators or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies. Another example is Presearch, a decentralized search engine platform known to offer free crypto rewards with its native cryptocurrency Presearch tokens (PRE) for conducting online searches. Users earn PRE tokens by searching through the Presearch platform instead of traditional search engines like Google or Bing. To earn free crypto coins through these platforms, users generally need to create an account, enable the rewards program, and engage in desired activities such as viewing ads or conducting searches. The exact requirements and rewards vary between platforms. However, it is important for users to take precautions when participating in these reward programs to avoid scams and fraudulent schemes. It is advisable to research and choose well-established platforms with positive user reviews and transparent operations. Users should also be cautious of any requests for personal information or financial details and ensure they use secure connections and reputable platforms. Crypto rewards cards have become a popular method for people to use digital currencies in their daily routine. These cards allow users to make payments and purchases using their cryptocurrencies, bridging the gap between traditional financial transactions and the world of digital currency. One of the major advantages of these cards is the ability to earn crypto rewards, most often in the form of cashback, on everyday purchases. Users can receive a small percentage of their transaction amount back in the form of cryptocurrency, which can then be used for future purchases or simply held as an investment. This feature not only provides additional value to users but also helps to encourage the adoption and usage of cryptocurrencies. Several platforms have introduced crypto-specific credit cards to cater to the growing demand. One example is the Coinbase Card: with it, users can spend their cryptocurrencies anywhere that accepts Visa. Another option is the Gemini Mastercard; its users can earn up to 3% back in Bitcoin or other digital currencies. The Binance Card is another popular choice, providing access to a wide range of cryptocurrencies and enabling seamless spending. Additionally, Nexo offers a credit card that allows users to instantly borrow against their crypto holdings while still having the ability to earn cashback. Play-to-earn games have gained significant popularity in recent years, connecting the worlds of gaming and cryptocurrency. These games enable players to not only engage in enjoyable gameplay but also earn real-world value in the form of cryptocurrency and other digital assets. Earning cryptocurrency through gameplay typically involves players completing in-game tasks, challenges, or missions. As players progress and achieve specific milestones, P2E platforms reward users with cryptocurrency or digital assets. These rewards can then be traded or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges for other virtual currencies or even real-world money. One of the main advantages of play-to-earn games is the potential for substantial rewards. Players who invest time and effort into these games can accumulate valuable digital assets, which can appreciate in value over time.  Some popular play-to-earn games include Axie Infinity, CryptoKitties, Decentraland, and Gods Unchained. Axie Infinity, arguably the best crypto game to date, is a blockchain-based game that allows players to collect, breed, and battle creatures called Axies. Players can earn the game’s native cryptocurrency, AXS, through various in-game activities. Referral programs are commonly offered by top crypto exchanges and wallets like Binance and Coinbase as a strategy to attract new users. These programs typically work by providing existing users with a unique referral link, which they can share with their friends and acquaintances. When a new user signs up via the referral link, both the referrer and the referee receive rewards or incentives. These rewards are often in the form of commission or referral bonuses, either in cryptocurrency or fiat currency, deposited directly into the referrer’s account. The amount of the reward can vary depending on the platform and the specific terms of the referral program. For example, Binance offers a referral program where users can earn 100 USDT rebate vouchers on trading fees.  These referral programs serve multiple purposes for crypto exchanges and wallets. Firstly, they incentivize existing users to promote the platform, helping to increase its user base. Secondly, they encourage new users to sign up by providing them with an extra incentive. Finally, by rewarding users with cryptocurrency, these programs also encourage engagement and usage of the platform. Crypto savings accounts have become an increasingly popular investment option for those looking to earn passive income on their digital assets. These accounts offer higher interest rates compared to traditional banking and present an opportunity to grow the value of cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, USDC, and USDT. Additionally, since cryptocurrencies have the potential for substantial price appreciation, the value of the assets held in these savings accounts can increase even further. While a crypto saving account might be a brilliant idea in theory, its execution leaves much to be desired. Celsius and BlockFi’s dramatic downfall highlights the fragility of centralized lending platforms in the crypto space. Celsius’ unraveling, triggered by regulatory investigations and founder Alex Mashinksy’s legal troubles, exposed deep-rooted flaws in the platform’s business model. Similarly, BlockFi’s troubles, including regulatory fines and liquidity issues, cast doubt on the sustainability of centralized lending operations. These incidents underscore the need for stringent regulatory oversight and investor vigilance in the crypto lending sector, prompting a shift towards decentralized alternatives that offer greater security and transparency. Get the top 50 crypto definitions you need to know in the industry for free Unlike its centralized brother, DeFi technology allows for transparent peer-to-peer lending, cutting out middlemen and potentially offering better yields than traditional financial institutions. Nexo, Aave, and Compound stand as pillars in the crypto lending landscape, boasting years of trust and reliability. Nexo provides instant crypto-backed loans and interest-bearing accounts, offering users avenues for passive income. Aave, a DeFi protocol on Ethereum, eliminates intermediaries, enabling seamless lending and borrowing with innovative features like flash loans. Compound, another Ethereum-based DeFi platform, offers competitive rates with algorithmic interest rates and real-time interest earnings. These crypto lending platforms provide secure alternatives to earning passive income and accessing liquidity, emphasizing the importance of research and risk awareness in crypto lending endeavors. To start experimenting with lending your crypto through DeFi apps, you’ll need a compatible crypto wallet such as Coinbase Wallet. This separate product from the main Coinbase app allows users to connect with various DeFi protocols like Compound or Aave. By supplying your cryptocurrency to these lending protocols, you can receive rewards for providing liquidity to borrowers. Starting with stablecoins can be a simple way to dip your toes into decentralized finance and explore the potential for higher returns on your crypto investments. Just remember to always exercise caution and stay informed about the risks associated with DeFi lending. Make sure to only invest what you can afford to lose and do thorough research before jumping into lending through DeFi protocols. Read also: What are Reddit’s MOONs and Bricks? Reddit Moons is a unique feature on the popular social media platform that allows users to earn cryptocurrency by actively participating in the r/cryptocurrency subreddit. To start earning MOON tokens, users need to first join the r/cryptocurrency subreddit. Once a member, engagement is key to earning Reddit Moons. Crypto enthusiasts can contribute to the subreddit by participating in discussions, posting original content, sharing news, and providing valuable insight on cryptocurrencies. By adding value to the community with their contributions, users increase their chances of earning MOON tokens. Earning Reddit Moons is based on a distribution system that takes into account various factors such as the quality of contributions, upvotes received, and overall participation. The more actively a user engages with the subreddit and the more valuable their contributions are, the higher their chances of earning MOON tokens. It is important to note that Reddit Moons are not given out randomly, but rather as a reward for active participation and contribution to the r/cryptocurrency community. This creates an incentive for users to engage in meaningful discussions and provide valuable insights, ultimately benefiting everyone in the subreddit. Staking is a concept in cryptocurrency, specifically applicable to proof-of-stake blockchains, that involves holding a certain number of tokens to help secure the network and earn rewards. The purpose of staking is to incentivize users to participate in the network’s operations, such as transaction verification or block validation. By staking their tokens, users contribute to the network’s security and decentralization. One of the main rewards of staking is earning additional tokens as a form of interest or dividend. This allows holders to passively generate income on their cryptocurrency investments. The rewards are often distributed proportionally amongst stakers, based on factors like the number of tokens staked or the duration of staking. However, staking also involves some potential risks. One significant risk is the locking up of funds for a predetermined period. During this time, the staked tokens are generally inaccessible for trading or other purposes. It is important to consider this illiquidity when deciding to stake because it can limit one’s ability to respond to crypto market conditions or take advantage of other investment opportunities. Additionally, there is a risk of losing the staked tokens if the network experiences a security breach or other technical issues. While staking is designed to enhance the network’s security, no system is entirely immune to vulnerabilities. It is essential to carefully evaluate the network’s reputation, security measures, and protocol stability before engaging in staking activities. Read also: Staking vs. Yield Farming.

Title: Trump Vs. Harris: Who Do Voters Trust More To Handle Crypto Policies?  - Benzinga
Date: Date not available
Content:
A new study has revealed that almost half of U.S. voters are in favor of pro-crypto policies, showing a growing willingness to cross party lines for candidates supporting cryptocurrency. The survey, conducted by HarrisX and Consensys indicates that 85% of those polled want presidential candidates to adopt a pro-crypto stance, highlighting the importance of crypto in the political arena. Voters Prioritize Pro-Crypto Policies According to the study, 49% of U.S. voters see a pro-crypto position as crucial, and a significant 62% are open to voting for a candidate from a different political party if they support crypto-friendly policies.  The data highlights that crypto is not confined to a single political ideology and that the party that takes a proactive approach towards cryptocurrency could gain a strategic advantage in the electoral landscape. The study further reveals that 44% of respondents think the current administration is not doing enough to support the crypto industry.  Additionally, 78% said they would back politicians who commit to protecting consumers from crypto-related scams, indicating a strong desire for effective regulation. Joe Lubin, CEO and co-founder of Consensys and Ethereum ETH/USD, said, “There's a myth that the crypto sector doesn't want regulation, but that's simply not true. Consensys is an active proponent of much-needed regulatory clarity to enable an industry that serves as the backbone of countless new technologies and innovations to thrive in the United States. We've been operating under a cloud of uncertainty for too long, and the results of this poll show that crypto is a bipartisan issue, with voters also calling for clarity and a pro-crypto stance."

When it comes to determining which U.S. body should regulate the crypto industry, opinions vary.  Only 15% of respondents believe the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently overseeing the crypto sector, while a mere 4% think the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is in charge.  Eleven percent of those surveyed say the U.S. Treasury Department is responsible, while another 11% believe the industry is self-regulating. Interestingly, when asked which entities or individuals have enough knowledge of crypto to set appropriate policies, 70% of participants chose the SEC, while 67% picked the CFTC.  This indicates a general trust in these institutions’ abilities to guide the future of crypto regulation. Political Figures and Crypto Understanding Among the politicians, former President Donald Trump received the highest score, with 53% of respondents believing he understands the crypto industry well enough to implement suitable policies.  This is significantly higher than the 41% who felt the same about Vice President Kamala Harris. President Joe Biden trails with only 36% of respondents confident in his understanding of the crypto sector.

Title: Visa unveils blockchain platform for banks to handle fiat-backed tokens
Date: October 3, 2024 at 1:15 pm
Content:

Share  Visa has announced a new platform to help banks issue and manage fiat-backed tokens on blockchain networks, with BBVA set to pilot the platform by 2025. Global payment network Visa has unveiled a blockchain-based platform to help financial institutions integrate fiat-backed tokens, aiming to bridge traditional banking and blockchain technology. In an Oct. 3 press release, Visa said the so-called Visa Tokenized Asset Platform will enable financial institutions to mint, burn, and transfer tokens backed by fiat currencies, such as stablecoins, with BBVA, a Spanish multinational banking giant, set to pilot the technology on the public Ethereum (ETH) blockchain in 2025. Visa says the VTAP solution integrates with existing banking infrastructure via APIs, allowing banks to explore tokenization use cases within a sandbox environment. The platform’s programmability also enables financial institutions to automate processes, such as “administering complex lines of credit using smart contracts and use fiat-backed tokens to release payments when payment terms are met.” “We’re excited to leverage our experience with tokenization to help banks integrate blockchain technologies into their operations.” Vanessa Colella, global head of innovation and digital partnerships, Visa Per the press release, BBVA has been testing the platform throughout 2024, focusing on token issuance, transfer, and redemption on testnet blockchains. However, it is unclear when exactly the Spanish giant plans on piloting the platform. Visa says its platform is designed to support interoperability across multiple blockchain networks, though it is unclear what other networks are in line for support. Earlier in May, Visa unveiled a study challenging the assumption that stablecoin transactions are approaching volumes seen in traditional payment networks. Cuy Sheffield, Visa’s head of crypto, noted that a significant portion of stablecoin activity is driven by automated bot transactions, rather than genuine usage. The findings, however, sparked debate, with some industry participants questioning Visa’s methodology. While Visa remains cautious about stablecoin adoption, others argue that stablecoins are still in a nascent stage and should not be dismissed based on current data.

Title: Taiwan FSC drafts new AML rules for crypto firms with penalties for non-compliance
Date: October 3, 2024 at 10:55 am
Content:

Share  Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission has drafted new anti-money laundering regulations for virtual asset service providers, which will soon require compliance or lead to penalties. According to a recent announcement, the FSC has introduced a draft of the ‘VASP Registration Regulations,’ which will take effect on Jan. 1, 2025.  These measures follow amendments to the AML Act made in July 2024 as part of Taiwan’s broader efforts to regulate the growing crypto sector. Unlike prior AML regulations, these new rules explicitly target cryptocurrency-related businesses, requiring virtual asset service providers—such as crypto exchanges, trading platforms, and custodians—to register and comply with stricter anti-money laundering protocols.  VASPs must submit annual risk assessment reports and set up internal control and audit systems as a part of the new rules. VASPs that have already completed compliance declarations under Taiwan’s existing AML laws must register under the new system within three months of the law’s effective date. Other firms, including new entrants, must complete their registration by the deadline of Sept. 30, 2025, to avoid penalties. According to local media, 26 businesses have already completed compliance declarations. If these entities fail to register in time, it could lead to up to two years in prison and a maximum fine of NT$5 million (roughly $156,140). Previously, penalties for non-compliance were only limited to fines. The FSC also mentioned that a comprehensive “special law” for virtual assets is in the works. A draft of this law is expected to be finalized by the end of December 2024 and submitted to the Executive Yuan by June 2025.  The special law will introduce further regulations, such as capital requirements, personnel qualifications, and other standards. The development follows FSC Chairman Huang Tianzhu’s earlier warning about a surge in illicit activities in the crypto space and his call for harsher penalties on non-compliant exchanges, adding that cryptocurrencies lack any direct connection to the real economy. Taiwan is also steadily aligning itself with global markets that are embracing digital asset investments. On Sept. 30, the FSC allowed professional investors, including institutional investors and high-net-worth entities, to access foreign crypto exchange-traded funds via local brokers. In June, regulators allowed BitoGroup, the parent company of Taiwanese crypto exchange BitoPro, to introduce crypto-friendly bank accounts in partnership with Far Eastern International Bank, allowing investors to avail banking services when transferring funds to the exchange.

On the other hand, Domino’s Pizza partnered with crypto payment service Coinify to allow Bitcoin payments. These restaurants and fast food joints are among a portion of local businesses embracing cryptocurrencies. Accepting cryptocurrencies is a growing trend in the food industry, offering customers in Chula Vista a unique experience with flexible payment options. The online entertainment scene in Chula Vista is vibrant with plenty of games and online events that can be paid for using cryptocurrency. Apart from P2E games where users can stake their gaming accounts with their favorite crypto, there are also digital casinos that accept cryptocurrencies as a valid payment method. These casino platforms provide players with several benefits such as anonymity and faster, secure transactions. Additionally, they offer a wide variety of casino gaming options, including poker, blackjack, baccarat, and sic bo online. However, entertainment options for Chula Vista residents aren’t limited to gaming but also extend to online events ranging from digital music concerts to edutainment webinars. Therefore, crypto enthusiasts can count on having something to spend their crypto on during their downtime in the city. The best part is they can do it from the comfort of their homes. Additionally, many online entertainment platforms using crypto typically offer attractive discounts or reward programs. These benefits are easily tokenized on blockchain networks. Users can earn NFTs or crypto tokens as rewards. These digital assets hold monetary value in various marketplaces. The retail sector in Chula Vista is gradually catching up in the movement to adopt cryptocurrency payments. Several stores are offering shoppers the opportunity to check out using digital assets. For example, several e-commerce platforms deliver locally, while some brick-and-mortar stores support Bitcoin and Ethereum as valid payment methods. The availability of options like Bitcoin gift cards has expanded the reach of digital currencies in retail stores, making it easier than ever to purchase items using them. Tech-forward stores have used this opportunity to modernize their payment options, adjusting to rapidly growing consumer preferences. If you’d also like to shop for products using crypto, marketplaces around San Diego tend to have many listings where sellers accept digital currencies. As Chula Vista is near San Diego, residents have access to other options, such as florists like South Park Flowers and bookstores like Chimera. As crypto adoption in retail continues to grow locally, more businesses are expected to start supporting digital asset payments. With expected innovations within the crypto payment processing industry, integrating currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum might be more convenient than ever, driving up the demand for faster integration among business owners. Several ATMs for withdrawing digital currencies have been set up around the city to increase the number of options for spending crypto. These Bitcoin ATMs make it easier for individuals to use crypto for everyday purposes like grocery shopping or buying gas. Bitcoin ATM locations in Chula Vista are designed for convenience.

Although Bitcoin is the prominent cryptocurrency for these facilities, some locations support Ethereum and Litecoin. A notable multi-crypto ATM is CVS on Broadway Street.

With more businesses turning to cryptocurrencies, Chula Vista benefits by stimulating local economic growth. Fortunately, the city’s community has a forward-thinking mentality, ready to adapt to evolving customer preferences and embrace new technologies that streamline consumer journeys. The expanding adoption of crypto can also be attributed to educational events like seminars, workshops, and meetups that equip business owners with all the information they need to keep up with the latest industry trends. These educational programs also prioritize customer preferences without compromising operational efficiency. The city government of Chula Vista has also played a role in fostering crypto adoption. Creating a supportive regulatory environment and partnering with blockchain companies has helped attract crypto-related businesses to the area. This has increased the availability of crypto services and created new job opportunities in the tech sector. Despite the progress, challenges remain. Some businesses are still hesitant due to crypto volatility and regulatory uncertainty concerns. However, these concerns will likely diminish as more stablecoins and regulatory frameworks emerge. Chula Vista is well-positioned to become a hub for cryptocurrency innovation and adoption, potentially serving as a model for other cities across the United States. Chula Vista is one of the prime destinations for crypto enthusiasts. It offers a wealth of options for spending digital assets, such as eateries, bookstores, and retail stores. Consumers also have access to several crypto ATMs. Since the city is located near San Diego, more retail stores support cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Residents and tourists can explore a wide range of entertainment options, including those that can be enjoyed from the comfort of home.

With a total raise exceeding $1.5 million in its ongoing presale, Rexas Finance is positioned to be the next major success story in the crypto space. Solana (SOL), with a 16,736% return in 2021, went from a $1.50 token to a staggering $259 at its peak. Its success is tied to its strong fundamentals, including fast transaction speeds and low fees. Solana’s focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs has cemented its place in the top three blockchains, trailing only Ethereum and Binance. Rexas Finance mirrors some of Solana’s key traits but introduces an even more transformative approach with its real-world asset tokenization.

Real estate, the world’s largest asset class, is now accessible to anyone, anywhere, thanks to Rexas Finance.

The sky truly is the limit for this project, as it aims to eliminate the gap between real-world assets and blockchain technology. Rexas Finance (RXS) is an ERC-20 token with a total supply of 1 billion. The presale, currently in its third stage, has already raised over $1.5 million, with the price increasing 1.7x from its initial offering. Stage 1 sold out quickly, raising $450,000, and Stage 2 was completed in less than a week, bringing the total raised to $1.25 million. At $0.05 per token, buyers in Stage 3 are set to see a 4x increase upon launch. Unlike other projects that raise funds from venture capitalists, Rexas Finance chose a public presale, giving retail investors the chance to participate in this groundbreaking opportunity. With no taxes on transactions and allocations for marketing, liquidity, treasury, and staking pools, Rexas Finance is structured for sustainable growth.  Rexas Finance is also launching a $1 million giveaway, with 20 lucky winners each receiving $50,000 in USDT.

Title: Cardano Creator Speaks Out on 'XRP Case' Appeal: New Crypto Test Incoming?
Date: Date not available
Content:
As is now known, the SEC has officially appealed its case against Ripple following a historical ruling on Aug. 7, in which Ripple was ordered to pay a $125 million civil penalty, which was a lot less than the $2 billion the regulator was asking for. The motive is that the district court's decision goes against long-standing Supreme Court precedents and established securities laws. Ripple's Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty said he was disappointed with the SEC's decision. He called the lawsuit "irrational" and "misguided" from the start and mentioned that the court had already rejected the SEC's claim that Ripple acted recklessly and that there were no allegations of fraud, victims or losses.

Ripple v SEC: Critical Appeal Dates XRP Community Can't Miss
Gamza Khanzadaev


 Alderoty’s comments drew a reaction from Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, who ironically suggested that the ongoing Ripple case could potentially replace the Howey Test, the legal precedent used to determine whether certain transactions qualify as investment contracts under U.S. securities law.  Stu, you ready to replace Howey with the Ripple Test :) Of course it is a sort of joke from Hoskinson. But considering that Howey was set in 1946, when the founders of XRP and Ripple were not even involved in the project, and that the Ripple case has become a focal point for many in the cryptocurrency market, it may not be so far from reality.

Title: Crypto Industry on Alert as Taiwan Implements Tougher AML Rules – Blockchain News, Opinion, TV and Jobs
Date: 3 October 2024
Content:
Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced today that the new Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations for virtual asset service providers will fully take effect in 2025.  The updated measures were released on October 2 by the FSC, which had earlier proposed improving the country’s crypto regulation rules. These new regulations have been in motion since March. New rules will require that all crypto firms register with the government by September 2025; otherwise, they will face serious penalties. For noncompliance or causing the server to fail, fines of up to 5 million New Taiwan dollars ($155,900) or a two-year jail sentence could be levied. The new regulations will replace the current system of Taiwanese VASPs starting on January 1, 2025. Those already adhering to previous AML standards must comply with the new compliance procedures and register with the government. Companies were advised to wait until the new system was operational and submit their documents to avoid confusion caused by different regulatory requirements. The new compliance framework also stipulates that VASPs must file annual risk assessment reports with the appropriate government agency. By the end of 2024, the FSC plans to produce a draft of its new proposal for crypto-related laws, which it expects to submit by June 2025. The Taiwanese government is expanding its involvement in the crypto industry by introducing new Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.  On September 30, the Taiwanese Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) ventured into the digital asset ETF market domain, allowing the market for investment aimed at local professional investors.  This effort is part of more extensive efforts to create more momentum in Taiwan’s competitiveness in the financial market in a way that aligns with neighboring financial hubs such as Hong Kong and Singapore. In its annual Crypto Crime Reports, Chainalysis released the latest findings on where illicit funds have moved over crypto wallets. It offers an in-depth analysis of how records are moved from crypto wallets.  In fact, these wallets are related to illegal activities such as crypto scams, exchange hacks, and darknet market dealings. It analyses how the funds from these wallets are counted from the initial placement stage to the layering one by conversion service. Conversion services let you exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat currency, or other crypto, for that matter, or vice versa, of course. Some examples of this would include centralized exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, gambling websites, crypto mixers, and blockchain bridges.  Blockchain technology offers the transparency of this on-chain money laundering process, which is easier to track and analyze than crypto-native other financial systems. Data shows these illicit wallets have transferred almost $100 billion to conversion services since 2019. Most funds were shifted from one entity to another in 2022 when $30 billion was moved, which was largely driven by transactions involving sanctioned entities mostly linked to the Russian-based exchange Garantex.

Title: Gurbir Grewal, Tough On Crypto, WhatsApp Messages, Leaves SEC - IndiaWest Journal News
Date: Date not available
Content:
India-West Staff Reporter WASHINGTON D.C – The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on October 2 that Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the Division of Enforcement, will step down from his position on October 11. Grewal’s departure comes after a prominent tenure marked by an aggressive crackdown on cryptocurrency violations and Wall Street’s use of unauthorized communications platforms. Grewal, who has led the SEC’s enforcement division since 2021, oversaw a team of 1,300 attorneys responsible for some of the agency’s most high-profile cases. Under his leadership, the SEC pursued hundreds of enforcement actions, including significant cases against financial institutions for non-compliance and fraudulent practices. His successor, Sanjay Wadhwa, the Division’s Deputy Director, will serve as Acting Director, while Sam Waldon, Chief Counsel of the Division, will step in as Acting Deputy Director. Enforcement Legacy Grewal’s tenure at the SEC is defined by his commitment to restoring investor confidence and ensuring market integrity. Under his leadership, the SEC brought over 2,400 enforcement matters, resulting in more than $20 billion in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. These cases also led to the return of billions of dollars to harmed investors. One of Grewal’s key initiatives was tackling emerging risks, particularly in the fast-growing cryptocurrency sector. The SEC authorized more than 100 enforcement actions related to the crypto industry, targeting some of the world’s largest crypto trading platforms for failing to comply with federal securities laws. Grewal’s team held these operators accountable for depriving investors of key protections, sending a clear message about the agency’s stance on crypto regulation. One of the most notable areas of Grewal’s enforcement work was the SEC’s aggressive stance on off-channel communications. Banks and financial institutions often rely on platforms like WhatsApp for business discussions, making it difficult for regulators to monitor for compliance. Under Grewal’s leadership, the SEC levied billions of dollars in fines on Wall Street firms for failing to maintain records of these communications. Bloomberg reported that Grewal was especially focused on preventing banks from bypassing regulatory oversight through unofficial channels. This crackdown resulted in sweeping penalties against major financial institutions, reinforcing the SEC’s commitment to transparency and accountability. High-Profile Cases Grewal’s tenure was marked by several high-profile enforcement actions. In May, the SEC announced $14 million in penalties against a Colorado firm that had vetted the financial records of Donald Trump’s social media company. Grewal criticized the firm as a “sham audit mill,” which led to a new auditor being selected days later. Another notable case under his leadership was the action taken against an audit firm responsible for over 1,500 filings with the SEC. This case was one of the largest enforcement actions involving an audit firm’s failure to meet its gatekeeping responsibilities. The SEC also charged another firm with hundreds of violations related to auditor independence, emphasizing the importance of ethical and professional standards among industry gatekeepers.  Grewal holds a J.D. from the College of William & Mary and a B.S. from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service.

Title: Ohio Senator Pushes For Use Of Crypto In Tax Payments
Date: Date not available
Content:
Bitcoin Ohio Ohio state senator, Niraj Antani, has introduced a bill seeking to legalize the use of crypto to pay state and local taxes and fees. S.B. 317 will essentially allow the use of Bitcoin and other digital assets to offset government bills in Ohio. Senator Antani of the Ohio 6th District introduced the Crypto Tax bill on Monday, Sept. 30, followed by a social media announcement in which the lawmaker expressed his faith in the prospects of the bill while describing himself as “the most pro-cryptocurrency Member of the Ohio Senate.” “Cryptocurrency is not just the future, but it’s the present of our 21st century economy. If we want to encourage innovation and free enterprise in Ohio, we should do everything we can to normalize the use of cryptocurrencies. By allowing Ohioans to pay their taxes with cryptocurrency, we will be on the cutting edge,” said Antani in a press release. According to the document, Ohio was the first US state to accept crypto for tax payment in Nov. 2018, under State Treasurer Josh Mandel. In 2019, however, the state Attorney General advised that “the state Board of Deposits must approve” tax payment using crypto. TODAY: I introduced a bill the legalize the use of cryptocurrency to pay state and local taxes and fees. Cryptocurrency is not just the future — it’s the present. I’m proud to be the most pro-cryptocurrency Member of the Ohio Senate. READ: pic.twitter.com/9lpYdkoGWT “This policy should have been acted on by the state Board of Deposits when it was deemed necessary,” added Antani. Since they have failed to act, the legislature will.” By extension, the bill will allow Ohio colleges, universities, and pension funds to invest in crypto if they so decide. In Feb. 2024, H.B. 406, the Blockchain Basics Act was introduced in Ohio. The bill sponsored by Rep. Steve Demetriou protects the financial rights of Ohio residents by allowing them to buy, sell, mine, self-custody their digital assets and run blockchain nodes. Ohio was the 16th state this year to introduce a Bitcoin rights bill, according to Dennis Porter of the Satoshi Action Fund—a nonprofit advancing US-wide adoption of Bitcoin. Besides Ohio, several other US states have begun pushing for crypto adoption. So far, Oklahoma and Louisiana have enacted the Bitcoin Rights Bill providing for their residents’ rights to trade Bitcoin and mine the crypto, among other freedoms. Last month, Louisiana processed its first crypto payment. This came after Governor Jeff Landry endorsed House Bill 488, affording Louisianans their fundamental Bitcoin rights while banning a potential Central Bank Digital Currency. The American crypto industry has weathered the storms of its securities regulator’s regulation by enforcement and poor industry guidelines and continues to blaze the trail as the world’s crypto giant. At this rate of crypto adoption, the US is will remain the world’s biggest innovation and tech leader in the coming years.

Michael Saylor, an American businessman and CEO of MicroStrategy, is known for being a big supporter of Bitcoin (BTC). He recently made another post about the major cryptocurrency.

In what may be a new description for the major cryptocurrency, Saylor referred to it as "lightning in a bottle," accompanied by the image of lightning in a Bitcoin bottle.

 In general, Saylor's new statement is part of an idiom - to catch lightning in a bottle - meaning to succeed in a very fortunate or unlikely way.  #Bitcoin is Lightning in a Bottle⚡️ pic.twitter.com/rBzqigtBwS On the one hand, one could argue that Bitcoin indeed offers this very rare opportunity to become extremely lucky. On the other hand, the very idea of lightning in a bottle can be thought of as a concentrated bundle of energy, and perhaps, in Saylor's opinion, it is an indication that Bitcoin has yet to reach its full potential, and when the bottle is opened, the cryptocurrency will explode with a burst of power.

Bullish Bitcoin 'Uptober' Tweet From NBA Legend Who 'Talks' to Satoshi
Yuri Molchan


 While Michael Saylor continues to support Bitcoin with bullish posts and tweets that only hint at the potential exponential growth to come, the first cryptocurrency itself is falling victim to geopolitical tensions and the capitulation of market participants.  Thus, since the beginning of the week of the new month of October, the price of BTC lost 7.84% and found itself at around $60,400.

Title: This Catalyst Could Give Bitcoin (BTC) the ‘Next Big Jolt,’ Says Billionaire Mike Novogratz - The Daily Hodl
Date: Date not available
Content:
The chief executive of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital says that one new factor could be a huge bullish catalyst for Bitcoin (BTC). In a new interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, billionaire Mike Novogratz says options trading for spot market Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could send the flagship crypto soaring. “The next big jolt to Bitcoin is going to be when we have options that trade on the ETFs. The SEC said they’re coming. I don’t know if it’s in three weeks or a month.” Late last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved options on BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. Novogratz believes there is a pent up demand for Bitcoin ETF options trading based on the trading action of MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR). “If you look at MicroStrategy as the one place right now you can get leverage on Bitcoin as a retail investor, it trades at more than 2.3 times the value of the Bitcoin it has, mostly because of the options. Often most weeks it’s the single largest option stock in the whole market. And that tells me something, that there’s a whole bunch of young guys on [trading platform] Robinhood that want to play crypto, that want to do it with leverage.”  He also predicts that inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs will continue well into the future. “I think this will be an ongoing play over the years, not over the months.” Next up, he says that there is a chance the US will adopt more regulatory clarity for digital assets in about one year, regardless of who wins the November US presidential election. He believes the regulatory clarity would increase traditional finance (TradFi) adoption of crypto and ignite blockchain innovation. “I do think, though, going forward, both the House and the Senate and that whoever’s in the executive side is going to be pro-crypto…  I think it’s relatively simple what DC has to do. They have to pass a market infrastructure bill that’s not too suffocating… Once there’s clarity, you’ll see a lot more innovation on blockchains. So it’s a market infrastructure bill, a stablecoin bill and it’s a direction to the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) to let TradeFi companies hold crypto on their balance sheets.” Bitcoin is trading for $60,786 at time of writing.   Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Apply now! The bitcoin price has dropped to almost $60,000 per bitcoin, wiping away most of the gains it made following China's bombshell. Now, after Elon Musk revealed the details of his secret meeting with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, the Tesla billionaire has warned the U.S. heading for bankruptcy after the country's debt jumped $204 billion in one day. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has warned the U.S.'s could collapse into "bankruptcy" due to its debt ... [+] spiraling out of control—something some think could turbo-charge the bitcoin price. "America is headed for bankruptcy," Musk posted to X, the social media platform he bought and rebranded from Twitter, linking to a report of U.S. debt surging on October 1. "Federal debt explodes on 1st day of the new fiscal year, jumping $204 billion to new record of $35.669 trillion, but it gets worse: Treasury also had to draw down its cash balance by $72 billion—that's over $275 billion in the red for just one day," EJ Antoni, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, posted. Last month, Musk met with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, who made history when he adopted bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador in 2021, with Bukele predicting the U.S.'s days could be numbered. U.S. debt interest payments are forecast to hit $870 billion this year, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office earlier this year after runaway inflation pushed the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a never-before-seen clip in the aftermath of huge Covid-era spending and money-printing. U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures. "As both Republican and Democratic parties do not appropriately address the ever-increasing U.S. debts and deficits during this election, this will be very bullish for bitcoin especially post the U.S. election," CK Zheng, chief investment officer of crypto hedge fund ZX Squared Capital, told Cointelegraph. Earlier this year, Bank of America analysts warned the U.S. debt load is about to ramp up to add $1 trillion every 100 days—potentially fueling a bitcoin price surge—and could reach $36 trillion by the end of 2024. Last month, the Fed kicked off its interest rate cutting cycle, taking the market somewhat by surprise with a 50 basis point reduction and fueling expectations of a similar sized cut in November—described as "crazy" by BlackRock's chief executive.

[+] billionaire Elon Musk and others warn over the huge U.S. debt pile and fears swirl of U.S. dollar collapse. Bitcoin price swings this week come as tensions rise in the Middle East between Israel and its neighbors, with fears growing the regional conflict could spiral to a wider war—highlighting bitcoin's role as a U.S. dollar and debt hedge. "Observers of bitcoin prices this week would once again note that it is not a safe haven against geopolitical concerns," Geoff Kendrick, head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, wrote in an emailed note. "I think this is normal. Gold is a geopolitical hedge. bitcoin is a hedge against [traditional finance] issues such as bank collapses ... or de-dollarisation/U.S. Treasury sustainability issues."

Title: Metaplanet sells put options to grow Bitcoin stash by nearly 24 BTC
Date: Date not available
Content:
The Bitcoin-only firm explained that it wants to tap into BTC's volatility for profit. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin investment firm Metaplanet said it sold 233 BTC put options and earned a premium of 23.97 BTC, according to an Oct. 3 statement. The firm stated it sold 223 contracts for $62,000 BTC put options, set to expire on Dec. 27, 2024. These contracts were fully backed by $13.8 million generated from Metaplanet’s 11th stock acquisition rights exercise. A put option is a type of financial contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specific stock or asset at a set price (called the strike price) within a specific time period. Each contract earned Metaplanet 0.1075 BTC in premiums, accumulating to a total of 23.97 BTC. This income brought the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings to 530.72 BTC, acquired at a cost of ¥4.965 billion (around $33.8 million). Metaplanet revealed it had entered into this agreement with QCP Capital, a Singapore-based digital asset trading firm. Metaplanet explained that its goal was to leverage Bitcoin’s volatility to generate income while keeping its cash-secured position. It stated: “This strategy not only enhances the Company’s Bitcoin reserves but also reinforces its balance sheet, aligning with our ongoing financial strategy to strengthen long-term Bitcoin exposure and improve the Company’s financial position, supporting its path toward profitability.” Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich highlighted the strategy’s alignment with the company’s broader goals. He emphasized that this approach allows them to grow their Bitcoin holdings without solely relying on direct purchases. Gerovich explained that while most of their assets remain in Bitcoin, using some for options strategies helps generate additional income. This dual approach allows them to increase holdings while benefiting from a steady income stream. The strategy also supports Metaplanet’s aim to generate annual profits and increase shareholder value, all while maintaining its focus on Bitcoin. He concluded: “Metaplanet remains committed to being a Bitcoin-only company, focused on maximizing our long-term exposure to this transformative asset. By utilizing both direct holding and yield-generating strategies, we position ourselves to capitalize on Bitcoin’s growth potential while maintaining a stable and profitable foundation.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power. Also known as "Akiba," Liam is a reporter, editor and podcast producer at CryptoSlate.

Reclassifying digital assets under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act could significantly reduce the current 55% tax rate on crypto gains. Japanese firm Metaplanet sees 500% stock increase, fueled by Bitcoin investments. Metaplanet's Bitcoin ambitions grows with its latest partnership with Japan's SBI.  Oasys and SBI Holdings aim to expand blockchain technology use cases in Asia's booming gaming industry. Mounting global debt and technological advances push Bitcoin closer to mainstream integration.

Title: Bitcoin Trades Flat While Other Major Cryptos Nurse Losses

Election 2024 coverage presented by This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.

CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,868.26 -3.74% Bitcoin (BTC): $60,722.20 -0.88% Ether (ETH): $2,366.16 -3.13%  S&P 500: 5,709.54 -0.01% Gold: $2,647.23 -0.49% Nikkei 225: 38,552.06 +1.97% Bitcoin was flat during the Asian and European mornings, trading about 0.8% lower in the last 24 hours at around $60,750. Iran’s air strikes on Israel, for which the latter has vowed to retaliate, continue to weigh on risk assets, such as bitcoin. Other major cryptos are nursing more significant losses than BTC with ether down over 4.5% at $2,350. The broader digital asset market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index is around 4.2% lower. XRP is the worst affected, having dropped 11% after the SEC filed an appeal against the ruling in Ripple's favor over their long-standing legal dispute. Despite the generally negative direction in crypto prices, whales are continuing to accumulate bitcoin at unprecedented rates, CryptoQuant founder Ki Young-Ju said in an X post. Whales colloquially refer to influential entities that hold largest amounts of any asset - and on-chain data shows new bitcoin whales are making sizable purchases in anticipation of a bull run ahead. "Real whales move the market through spot trading and OTC markets," he wrote. "That’s why on-chain data is crucial. The older whales haven’t seen particularly high returns, and the whales who entered in this recent bull run have barely made any profits." Tokyo-listed bitcoin holder Metaplanet Inc. is now using bitcoin options to boost its BTC stash. The company announced the sale of 223 contracts of bitcoin put options at the $62,000 strike with a maturity date of Dec. 27. The transaction involved Singapore-based QCP Capital as the counterparty and generated a premium of 23.972 BTC ($1.44 million). Metaplanet posted $13.826 million as margin collateral, with each contract offering a 0.1075 BTC premium, which Metaplanet received upfront. The transaction resulted in a nominal yield of 10.75% and an annualized yield of 45.63%. Metaplanet will use the premium received to purchase more bitcoin. The company’s total bitcoin holdings are worth around $32 million. - Jamie Crawley Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

Title: Bitcoin’s MVRV Peaks Lower Than Previous Cycles, Suggesting Room for Gains
Date: October 3, 2024
Content:
[ccpw id="39382"] Date:  Written By:   Follow Us On While Bitcoin has struggled to set a new all-time high for over six months, its MVRV ratio remains below past peaks, signaling potential for further gains. According to a recent analysis by IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin exhibits signs of potential upside, regardless of ongoing bearish sentiment. The analysis highlights the importance of the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio in gauging Bitcoin’s cycle top. In the current market cycle, Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio peaked at 2.64 in March, a relatively low value compared to previous bull markets. Accordingly, the market intelligence platform suggested that Bitcoin’s rally may not be complete, with room for further upward movement before the market reaches a true top. IntoTheBlock’s historical data reveals key insights into Bitcoin’s past performance. During the 2017 market cycle, the MVRV ratio reached a peak of 4.35, while the 2021 cycle saw a high of 3.7.  Hence, the current MVRV of 2.64 remains significantly lower, indicating that the cryptocurrency still has some distance to cover before reaching a cycle’s top comparable to previous cycles.  📊 Historical MVRV Insights: 2017 Peak: 4.352021 Peak: 3.7 During the current cycle, MVRV peaked at 2.64, which seems relatively low to signal a market top. 🤔 🔍 What MVRV level are you keeping an eye on? pic.twitter.com/Vq2iViWEtp — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) October 3, 2024  Another indication that Bitcoin’s top is not in yet may be seen via whale activity. The founder of CryptoQuant, Ki Young Ju, has observed that Bitcoin whales, particularly those holding large amounts of the cryptocurrency, have not yet seen substantial profits in this market cycle.  Many new whale wallets, including custodial wallets and ETF-related accounts, have shown limited gains. This suggests that these major holders are likely to continue holding rather than selling off their positions. This accumulation of Bitcoin by whales further supports the notion that the market may have more room to grow. The whales are reportedly acquiring large quantities of Bitcoin through over-the-counter (OTC) markets, adding to the pressure on Bitcoin’s supply without contributing directly to the price volatility in exchanges. At press time, Bitcoin is trading around $61,000, down by over 4% since this week. Disclaimer: This content is informational and should not be considered financial advice.

The cryptocurrency market has faced a significant price correction over the last few days. Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen below $61,000, and the global crypto market cap has dipped 4.2% in the previous 24 hours to $2.2 trillion. Solana (SOL) and other crypto assets follow BTC’s downward trend, facing substantial price corrections. This price prediction article will discuss how high SOL can go over the coming weekend. Also Read: Bitcoin’s Next Big Move: $85K Target or Cooling Period? SOL’s price is down 5.8% in the daily charts, 8.9% in the weekly charts, and 0.9% in the 14-day charts. The asset has maintained some gains in the monthly and yearly charts, rallying 2.9% and 470.6%, respectively. October has historically been a bullish month for the crypto market. However, the current market sentiment seems to defy this trend. Major assets are in the red zone, facing significant sell-offs.

The platform predicts SOL will hit $147.98 on Sunday, Oct. 6, 2024. Reaching $147.98 from current prices will translate to a rally of about 7.65%.

Title: Analyst Justin Bennett Issues Bitcoin Alert, Says BTC Could Plunge Lower Before Bouncing – Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl
Date: Date not available
Content:
Analyst and trader Justin Bennett is issuing a warning on Bitcoin (BTC) amid the flagship crypto asset’s single-digit correction over the past couple of days. Bennett tells his 111,500 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could fall below $60,000 before trending higher. According to the cryptocurrency analyst and trader, Bitcoin needs to turn resistance levels into support levels to confirm an uptrend. “But a sweep without a reclaim is a potential break with follow-through and probably not something you want to long. The reclaim is the trigger. It’s what tips the scales from possible to probable. No trigger, no trade.” Bennett further says, “Downtober before Uptober in my opinion. Given the last six months of price action, what are the odds that the BTC September candle doesn’t get partially retraced before the next rally?” In September, Bitcoin hit a low of around $52,500 and a high of about $66,500. According to the cryptocurrency analyst and trader, the Tether (USDT) dominance level (the ratio of USDT’s market cap relative to the rest of the crypto market) must fall before Bitcoin can rally. “For Bitcoin to reach all-time highs, Tether dominance must break its 2018 trend line. There’s no other way. That’s not a bearish crypto comment, it’s just an observation. All trend lines break eventually. This will also be the most painfully obvious signal that BTC is ready for all-time highs.” Bitcoin is trading at $61,145 at time of writing.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available. The road to a new all-time high (ATH) is filled with a plethora of obstacles for Bitcoin (BTC). From geopolitical issues to monetary policies and socioeconomic hurdles, a major price breakout looks like a far-fetched idea. This is a serious concern especially in the month of October, also known as "Uptober" in the crypto community. October is a crucial month for the Bitcoin price, and if history is any guide, BTC has usually performed pretty well at this time of year. However, the first three days of October have been discouraging so far. As expected, the crypto community was quick to change its expectations, as they have renamed their so-called favorite month to "Rektober." While Bitcoin's price performance has been on the bearish side so far, some analysts are still believing in the "Uptober" theory. For instance, renowned analyst Jelle has shared his positive Bitcoin price prediction. He still believes that a notable price breakout is in the cards for the largest cryptocurrency on the market. Jelle took to X (formerly Twitter) to tell his 91.9K followers that all is not lost for Bitcoin. He explained that bull market summers are typically choppy in nature. The analyst said that this year has also been the same so far. By "choppy," he means a period of consolidation and consistent price dips after a brief period of rallies. However, Jelle gave his followers good news. He said that the Bitcoin price historically breaks out of the consolidation range in the second or probably the third week of October. If this happens, there will be no debate, and October will finally be crowned as "Uptober," or the best month for the market. In concluding his analysis, Jelle mentioned that if this historic pattern repeats itself, then the market is going to witness a new all-time high for Bitcoin later this month.

Investors are likely to maintain a cautious stance as they assess the situation in the region. For now, $60,000 serves as a key support level, while resistance is set at $62,100. Other major coins such as Ethereum, Solana and XRP also corrected by as much as 10% due to uncertainty.” CoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, “Bitcoin’s modest rebound following the sell-off driven by geopolitical turmoil stalled at $62,400 during Wednesday’s U.S. session, before tumbling to $60,000—a key psychological support level. BTC has dropped 3% in the past 24 hours, while the broader crypto market, represented by the CoinDesk 20 index, declined by 3.8%.” Avinash Shekhar, Co-founder & CEO, Pi42, said, “Bitcoin recovered 2% after the brief fall to $60,000 Yesterday due to the tensions in Middle east and currently trading just above at $61,100. However, each of the election years has turned green for all of October, November, and December, which makes the fourth quarter a favourable time for Bitcoin. Bitcoin derivatives metrics look neutral. A 2-month futures premium sits at 7%. It's evidence that Bitcoin has the ability to rebound from recent volatility. On the other hand, Ethereum's breakdown below $2,400 spells out a bearish outlook that can pull down by as much as 7% to a little less than $2,200. Ethereum is currently trading just above $2,300. The optimism regarding Ethereum seems to point towards a bearish trend. While Bitcoin's will show a bullish trend as Bitcoin's momentum will go on given what it has done in the past."  Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, “Bitcoin fell to around $60,000 on Wednesday amid escalating tensions following Iranian missile attacks on Israel in retaliation for Israeli actions against militant leaders and Hezbollah. The cryptocurrency fell 3.1% for the day and 4.4% for the week, reflecting increased risk aversion among investors. The US sent military support to Israel, further raising geopolitical concerns. While Bitcoin saw significant inflows at the end of September, the trend reversed with a notable outflow of $242.5 million on October 1st. Analysts noted that despite current tensions, bitcoin posted its strongest September close in more than a decade.” Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, “Bitcoin has shown resilience, reclaiming the $61,000 mark after a dip to $60,300 amid rising geopolitical tensions following Iran's missile strikes on Israel. Over the past day, Bitcoin has experienced a modest decline of 0.09%, reflecting increased market caution amid these developments. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced plans to appeal a court ruling that could impact its regulatory authority over digital assets, particularly concerning Ripple's XRP token. Bitcoin has the potential to grow in Q4 2024 despite these obstacles, particularly given October's historically positive trends for the cryptocurrency.”  Subscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive Disclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

Title: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Flat Near $61K as Whales Continue to Accumulate; XRP Down 10% as SEC Appeals Case
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) continued in the red at the start of Asian trading hours Thursday as the market withstood another sell-off. BTC is flat, trading above $61,100, while ETH is down 4% and trading at $2,390. Crypto markets took a hit from Tuesday night after Irani airstrikes on Israel, which the latter has vowed to retaliate, in a move that has dented a rally in risk assets, including bitcoin. However, whales continue to accumulate bitcoin at unprecedented rates despite the macro environment and market dullness, CryptoQuant founder Ki Young-Ju said in an X post. Whales colloquially refer to influential entities that hold largest amounts of any asset - and on-chain data shows new bitcoin whales are making sizeable purchases in anticipation of a bull run ahead. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, was down over 3% as investors continue to sell most major cryptocurrencies. Outflows from the BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued with $91.76 million in outflow during the Wednesday U.S. trading day. Ether ETFs experienced the opposite, with inflows of $14.45 million, breaking a two-day streak of outflow. XRP plunged more than 10% in the past 24 hours after the U.S. SEC said on Wednesday that it is appealing a court ruling restricting its ability to regulate cryptocurrency markets. The SEC will ask the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review a July 2023 decision that the XRP token sold by Ripple Labs on public exchanges did not meet the legal definition of a security. Memecoin mog (MOG), the second-largest cat-themed token behind popcat (POPCAT), saw little price movement after getting an automated mention from Republican candidate Donald Trump's X account. Trump's account seems to be sending a reply to any account that liked his tweet A Polymarket market tracking Trump's mention of the word "mog" - or related adjectives - before December 31 was unchanged at 13% of "yes" votes, leading to some drama among voters. Elsewhere in the market, LDO, the native token of non-custodial staking solution Lido, is down nearly 9%, following Ether's decline. Artificial Intelligence tokens are also not moving, despite an announcement from OpenAI that it had raised $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion. CoinGecko data shows that the category, which includes (NEAR), {{TAO}}, and (ICP) is down 1.8%. Worldcoin, which was founded by OpenAI's Sam Altman, but has no formal ties otherwise to OpenAI, is down 4%. UPDATE (Oct 3, 07:00 UTC): Updates eighth paragraph to clarify Donald Trump mentioning Mog on X was an automated response. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

Title: Brandt Identifies Bitcoin “3 Blind Mice” Pattern Amid Drop: Here’s What It Means for BTC Prices
Date: October 3, 2024
Content:
[ccpw id="39382"] Date:  Written By:   Follow Us On Bitcoin has recently taken a dip after reaching a two-month high, with market veteran Peter Brandt pointing out an unusual trading pattern. As the leading cryptocurrency struggles to regain its footing following a sharp correction, Brandt recently presented the investing public with a pattern he calls the “Three Blind Mice and a Piece of Cheese.”  Toward the end of September, Bitcoin hit a high of $66,508, marking its best performance in two months. However, the excitement was short-lived, as the firstborn crypto retraced by more than 7.7% over the following days, dropping to around $60,221 yesterday. Brandt’s 1-day chart shows three consecutive bearish daily candles, with prices sliding below important technical levels. Amid the correction, analysts wonder if the worst is yet to come or if Bitcoin is preparing for another breakout. This downturn coincides with growing global uncertainty, especially surrounding tensions in the Middle East, which has led investors to shy away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. The bearish resolve has neutralized the bullish momentum expected in “Uptober.” Brandt’s “three blind mice” pattern has further bolstered concerns around Bitcoin’s price action. Although he has not fully explained this term, some analysts suggest it may refer to a continuation pattern, where the price is likely to follow the established bearish trend from the three bearish candles.  Analysts refer to similar setups, such as the “Three Black Crows” pattern, as a bearish signal that a market is losing steam and could face continued selling pressure. With Bitcoin now trading below two key moving averages, the short-term outlook appears dim. Brandt’s chart shows that Bitcoin’s current price sits below the 8-day and 18-day moving averages. This signals weakness in the short term, implying that sellers have gained control. If Bitcoin does not recover above these levels soon, further losses could spring up. Meanwhile, the ADX is hovering around 21.37. This number suggests that the current trend lacks strength. The positioning indicates that the market is in a consolidation phase, but the risk of further downward movement remains high. Brandt previously suggested BTC is still in the bearish phase.  Despite the recent downturn, Bitcoin’s psychological and technical support at $60,000 remains intact for now. If the price breaks below this level, it could lead to another wave of selling. This new wave could push Bitcoin towards the $58,000 mark. However, the ATR shows rising volatility, which means traders should expect larger price swings in the coming days. Despite the difficulty in predicting Bitcoin’s next direction, indicators suggest that a deeper correction is still possible. While Bitcoin’s decline has disappointed bulls, the market could still experience a reversal. Historically, October has been a strong month for crypto, and if Bitcoin can hold above $60,000, there’s potential for a rebound toward $65,000.

Title: Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin Slides to $61,379 as Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt
Date: 03 Oct 2024, 5:50 am
Content:
Crypto Price Today: The global crypto market experienced sharp declines today as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel escalated. Iran launched a series of missiles at Israel, raising concerns about a broader conflict in the Middle East. The news sent shockwaves not only through traditional financial markets but also through the cryptocurrency market, traditionally considered a refuge in times of uncertainty. Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies faced a substantial drop following the developments in the Middle East. Despite being considered a potential safe-haven asset, Bitcoin’s performance during this crisis raised questions about its resilience and reliability as a hedge against global instability. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently trading at $61,379.90, marking a 0.56% decline over the past 24 hours and a 3.33% decrease over the past week. This recent dip is reflective of broader market sentiment as investors brace for further escalation in the region. The first chart displays the BTC/USDT 15-minute timeframe. The most recent candles indicate an upward trend in price, with Bitcoin recovering slightly after hitting the local bottom of $60,524.21. The Bollinger Bands show widening, suggesting increased volatility in the near term. The 15-minute chart reflects short-term bullish momentum as Bitcoin tries to stabilize above the lower Bollinger Band. However, the candle patterns reveal resistance near $61,493.18, a level that the bulls have struggled to break. This resistance zone is reinforced by the previous high of $61,940.00, a level that will act as a key barrier for the continuation of the upward trend. The BTC/USDT hourly chart further illustrates the market dynamics with a clearer view of the recent price movements. The chart shows a significant downtrend that began at the $65,432.00 level, a high point before the geopolitical tensions impacted the market. Bitcoin hit a recent low of $60,164.00 before attempting to recover. The hourly Bollinger Bands indicate that Bitcoin has found temporary support at the lower band. However, the presence of a downward-sloping middle band indicates that selling pressure is still present, and a decisive move above the $61,386.91 resistance level is needed to confirm a potential reversal. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, faced an even sharper decline, dropping 3.70% in the last 24 hours to reach $2,396.62. Over the past week, ETH has lost 7.86% of its value, underperforming compared to Bitcoin. Solana (SOL), known for its high-speed transaction capabilities, dropped by 3.09% to trade at $142.54, as market participants evaluated the impact of rising geopolitical tensions. Over the past week, SOL has seen a 4.39% drop, reflecting investor caution towards high-volatility assets. Ripple (XRP), which often sees independent price movements due to its unique use case and legal battles, fell by 10.71% to $0.54 in the last 24 hours. This sharp decline comes as the broader market sentiment worsens, and XRP holders brace for further regulatory impacts. The geopolitical conflict between Iran and Israel has rattled investors across all asset classes. The cryptocurrency market, often touted as a non-correlated asset class and a potential hedge against traditional financial instability, has shown vulnerability in the face of such global events. The swift reaction of Bitcoin and Ethereum to the news highlights a crucial point: despite the narrative of cryptocurrencies being a safe-haven asset, they are still largely influenced by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. The fear of escalation in the Middle East has led to a risk-off sentiment, with traders and investors seeking safety in the U.S. dollar and gold, resulting in sell-offs in both the traditional and digital asset markets. Despite the overall negative trend, a few cryptocurrencies managed to buck the trend and post gains: Flare (FLR) emerged as the top gainer, up by 13.51% to trade at $0.01674. The positive movement is likely driven by recent announcements of network upgrades and new partnerships, which have increased investor interest. Wormhole (W) and Aptos (APT) followed suit, with gains of 8.49% and 8.26%, respectively. The rise in APT can be attributed to strong ecosystem developments and cross-chain integration initiatives that are garnering attention. Stacks (STX) and Sui (SUI) also saw gains of 7.52% and 6.98%, respectively. These projects have benefited from the recent surge in interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). On the other hand, some cryptocurrencies took a significant hit today: EigenLayer (EIGEN) was the biggest loser, dropping by 16.64%. The sudden decline is likely due to a combination of market sell-offs and specific concerns over the project’s latest developments. Beam (BEAM) and Ethena (ENA) followed with losses of 16.16% and 13.56%, respectively. Both projects are relatively low-liquidity assets, making them more susceptible to large price movements during market sell-offs. Ripple (XRP), despite its strong community backing, saw a sharp 10.29% decline, reflecting the market’s bearish stance and potential concerns over the ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The current market sentiment remains cautious, with the majority of cryptocurrencies trading in the red. Bitcoin's failure to maintain the $62,000 support level highlights the vulnerability of the market amid rising geopolitical uncertainties. The immediate focus will be on how the geopolitical situation evolves. Any signs of de-escalation in the Middle East could lead to a quick recovery in the cryptocurrency markets. However, if tensions continue to rise, further downside could be expected. In the meantime, investors are likely to continue seeking refuge in stable assets such as stablecoins, the U.S. dollar, and gold. For cryptocurrencies, breaking key resistance levels such as $61,940 for Bitcoin and $2,500 for Ethereum will be critical to reversing the current downtrend. The ongoing market dynamics highlight the need for caution and the importance of diversification. While cryptocurrencies remain an innovative and disruptive asset class, their performance during periods of global instability is still far from being consistent or predictable.

Title: New Whales Fiercely Accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) Like Never Before, According to CryptoQuant CEO - The Daily Hodl
Date: Date not available
Content:
Crypto whales are aggressively accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) in an unprecedented manner, according to the CEO of a prominent analytics firm. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju tells his 363,000 followers on the social media platform X that the market hasn’t seen the current behavior from whales. He shares a chart suggesting that new whales have gone on rapid buying sprees while older whales have remained conservative. “Look at how fiercely the new whales are stacking Bitcoin; this market has never seen such accumulation.” Ju says that the recent correction from the $67,000 level to about $61,000 is more about games in the futures markets rather than a cool-off of demand. Says the CEO, “Real whales move the market through spot trading and OTC markets. That’s why on-chain data is crucial. The older whales haven’t seen particularly high returns, and the whales who entered in this recent bull run have barely made any profits. They are unlikely to dump on exchanges until liquidity from retail investors starts flowing in.” In the past, new whales being in profit has hinted at market cycle tops for Bitcoin. In the current market cycle, Ju says that the new whale entities haven’t seen significant profit levels compared to other cycles. “The new whale wallets, primarily custodial wallets and ETFs, have not yet generated sufficient profit.” At time of writing, BTC is trading at $61,987.

Title: Options Traders Betting Big on Bullish October for Bitcoin (BTC), According to Analytics Firm Kaiko - The Daily Hodl
Date: Date not available
Content:
New data from the crypto market analytics firm Kaiko Research indicates traders are placing big bets that Bitcoin (BTC) will have a strong October. In a new report, Kaiko finds that derivatives traders are betting hundreds of millions of dollars on the crypto options exchange Deribit that Bitcoin is going to regain the $70,000 range this month. “Options volumes have increased over the past few weeks as markets shift to a risk-on mindset. Traders are positioning themselves to capture upside price movements ahead of what is historically BTC’s best trading month. BTC’s price has only ended October down twice since 2013.  Looking at the three expiries in October, we can see that most of the volume is focused on the BTC options expiring at the end of the month. Typically, the front-month contracts would have more volume and liquidity.” According to Kaiko, new macroeconomic conditions are also contributing to the traders’ behavior. “However, several factors make this year different. First, the US central bank began a rate-cutting cycle this month, shifting its monetary policy. The Fed’s jumbo rate cut has already boosted risk-on sentiment. The central bank has signaled two more cuts before the year’s end, prompting speculative trades on December 27 contracts with significant volume on strike prices above $100,000.  What hasn’t shown up in the markets yet is the effect of cheaper dollars and the eventual easing of the Fed’s quantitative tightening measures, which removed liquidity. Global liquidity lags the markets, so the effects of the Fed’s easing cycle will take longer to appear.” Bitcoin is trading for $61,026 at time of writing, down 3.9% in the last 24 hours.

Title: Bitcoin poised for an ATH in October? Arthur Hayes predicts… - AMBCrypto
Date: October 3, 2024
Content:
Arthur Hayes expressed strong confidence that Bitcoin could potentially reach a new all-time high this October. Read to know why!  After recently peaking at $65,000, Bitcoin [BTC] experienced a notable decline and was trading at $61,742—after decreasing 3.52% in the last 24 hours.  This drop coincides with escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, raising concerns among investors. However, Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMEX and Maelstrom, remains optimistic about BTC’s trajectory.   In a recent discussion following the TOKEN2049 events in Singapore, he expressed strong confidence that Bitcoin could potentially reach a new all-time high this October.  Hayes’ predictions provide a counterpoint to the current market volatility, suggesting that bullish sentiment may still prevail in the cryptocurrency space.  Remarking on the same, Hayes noted,  “In October. Before the election.” Arthur Hayes argues that the prevailing political instability in the U.S. has generated a “vacuum of power,” fostering chaos that could benefit Bitcoin.  He predicts a surge in liquidity as the 5th of November approaches, implying that this uncertainty will entice investors to gravitate toward cryptocurrencies as a more secure asset.  This shift in sentiment, he proposed, could catalyze a significant increase in BTC’s price as people seek refuge from traditional financial volatility. Adding to the excitement, Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, engaged the crypto community on X by playfully hinting at a promising month ahead with the term “Uptober.” Source: Anthony Scaramucci/X This clever fusion of “up” and “October” highlights an optimistic outlook for cryptocurrency markets this fall. That being said, Hayes also expressed his enthusiasm for memecoins, particularly Iggy Azalea’s MOTHER.  He highlighted the recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and China, hinting at an impending fiscal “bazooka” that could stimulate market activity.  Unlike many projects that often prioritize quick gains, Hayes appreciates the MOTHER team’s genuine commitment, noting their active involvement in the project rather than just aiming for a pump-and-dump scheme.  This authenticity, he believes, sets MOTHER apart in the evolving memecoin landscape.  Expressing his viewpoint, Hayes added,  “It’s meme coin season. We have a very positive liquidity environment, and meme coins are the most levered to that.”  Recently, on the 27th of September, the on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that Hayes made a significant withdrawal of 24.39 billion PEPE tokens, valued at approximately $252,680, from Binance.  This substantial move could indicate that PEPE is poised for a notable rally, suggesting that its upward momentum may have just begun and could potentially surge in the coming days.  Meanwhile, on the price front, Bitcoin experienced a decline of over 3% in the last 24 hours.  However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently at 48, is trending upwards, indicating a potential bullish trend reversal on the horizon. Source: Trading View Conversely, while MOTHER was down by more than 4% during the same period, its RSI, sitting at 61, points that bullish momentum is still outpacing bearish pressure.

Title: Bitcoin Poised for a Significant Rally Toward a New All-Time High
Date: Date not available
Content:
The Currency analytics 
Cryptocurrency News – REAL News ® – TCAT  Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a whirlwind of activity lately, facing downward pressure that temporarily pushed its price below the $64,000 mark. However, recent data indicates that the leading cryptocurrency might be preparing for a bullish rally that could lead it closer to a new all-time high (ATH).  As of now, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $63,952.64, with a market capitalization exceeding $1.2 trillion. Despite recent volatility, market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with indications suggesting that a price rebound could be on the horizon. CryptoQuant, a leading analytics platform, highlighted a noteworthy observation: low exchange flow multiple values were recorded prior to previous rallies in 2023. This pattern is emerging again, signaling a potential upward trend in the market. In a recent tweet, CryptoQuant stated, “The current indicator levels are similarly low, which could signal that the market is preparing for the next upward trend.” Such indicators often hint at underlying buying pressure that may soon propel Bitcoin’s price higher. Analyzing the data from CryptoQuant, we can see that Bitcoin’s Exchange Reserve is declining. A decrease in exchange reserves typically indicates that investors are buying and holding Bitcoin rather than selling it. This growing buying pressure often precedes price increases, making it a positive sign for BTC holders. Additionally, Bitcoin’s Binary CDD (Coin Days Destroyed) has shown bullish tendencies. This metric reflects the movement of long-term holders, and current readings indicate that these holders are less active in selling, suggesting confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Moreover, miners appear to be holding their coins as well. The Miners’ Position Index (MPI) indicates that miners are selling their holdings at a moderate pace compared to their one-year average. This reluctance to sell further suggests that key market participants are optimistic about future price movements. Despite these positive signals, Bitcoin is struggling to breach its critical resistance level of $65,000. The repeated rejections at this threshold have led to a consolidation phase, as BTC attempts to regain momentum and retest this resistance. If Bitcoin can achieve a bullish breakout above this level, analysts predict that the price could soar to around $73,000. Crossing this mark would open the door for the king coin to potentially reach new all-time highs in the coming weeks or months. As Bitcoin navigates this critical period, several factors will influence its trajectory. The increased buying pressure, combined with the bullish on-chain metrics, suggests that many market participants remain optimistic about BTC’s future. While the market is inherently volatile and subject to rapid changes, the current indicators hint at a favorable environment for Bitcoin. Should external conditions—such as macroeconomic factors or shifts in investor sentiment—remain supportive, BTC could well be on the brink of a significant upward movement. As the crypto market evolves, Bitcoin continues to be a focal point for investors. The combination of rising buying pressure, decreasing exchange reserves, and the behavior of long-term holders paints a promising picture for BTC. If Bitcoin can break through its resistance level, we might witness an exciting rally toward new all-time highs.

Title: Standard Chartered Issues Bitcoin Price Warning: BTC May Drop Before the Weekend – Deythere
Date: October 3, 2024
Content:
As geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel escalate, the entire cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin (BTC), has been hit hard. While BTC currently hovers around the $60,000 mark, analysts are predicting a potential drop below this critical level. According to analysts from Standard Chartered, the ongoing geopolitical risks may push Bitcoin below $60,000 before the weekend. Geoff Kendrick, the head of global digital asset research at Standard Chartered, stated that these geopolitical risks could trigger a significant decline in Bitcoin prices, as reported by The Block. Kendrick believes that the ongoing situation in the Middle East poses a serious threat to Bitcoin’s stability. “Geopolitical risks arising from the tensions between Iran and Israel may push Bitcoin below $60,000 before the weekend,” Kendrick explained. He also suggested that investors could view this potential drop as a buying opportunity.  In his analysis, Kendrick highlighted the relevance of 80,000-dollar call options and the growing anticipation surrounding Trump’s potential victory in the upcoming U.S. election. These factors could present a favorable outlook for Bitcoin in the long run, despite short-term volatility. “While geopolitical concerns may drag prices down, they also increase the likelihood of Trump’s victory, which could improve the post-election outlook for Bitcoin,” Kendrick added. Trump’s support for Bitcoin has been well documented, and his potential win is seen as a positive outcome for the BTC market. On the other hand, Standard Chartered previously mentioned that regardless of the U.S. election results, Bitcoin is expected to reach new highs by the end of the year. In a previous report, Standard Chartered predicted that BTC could reach as high as $125,000 if Trump wins, or $75,000 if Kamala Harris secures victory.

Date: Date not available

 Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are a sizzling subject proper now. Nonetheless, many individuals are nonetheless unconvinced about their worth, and a few don’t perceive what advantages they are going to convey to the financial system. Actually, the adoption of CBDCs will herald a brand new method of working with and utilizing cash on-line for everybody. However how will it work?  A CBDC is a digital foreign money issued by a rustic’s central financial institution. The central financial institution can handle the back-end infrastructure for the CBDC, whereas monetary establishments can provide wallets and different buyer companies to finish customers.  The central financial institution holds details about funds held by customers of that foreign money, which could be accessed by industrial monetary establishments.  There are various advantages to adopting CBDCs in a rustic, particularly one which makes use of blockchain for distributed knowledge storage. CBDCs will present enterprise and expertise alternatives for purposes and companies that might be extra environment friendly to make use of.  The BSV blockchain provides a number of advantages for CBDCs in international locations that select new digital currencies. Adopting a CBDC will profit retailers, service suppliers, software program homes, builders and others throughout the provision chain. Customers will profit, too: if a CBDC is carried out in a rustic, it might convey flexibility and option to everybody who makes use of the foreign money and add the arrogance of governance, safety, belief and traceability.  The Bitcoin blockchain brings privacy, which is completely different from anonymity, to transactions whereas sustaining governance and auditability. Privateness is maintained within the consumer’s Bitcoin pockets, which sits on the edges of the community quite than being underneath centralised management. Builders can create CBDC solutions to allow effectivity, privateness and safety for customers. Flexibility in pockets design signifies that the creator or developer of the pockets software program might retailer privateness data on the supplier in case the consumer’s pockets is compromised. On this case, the knowledge initially given to fulfill the Know Your Buyer (KYC) particulars could possibly be used to validate the consumer who can regain entry to their pockets. This might additionally cut back the possibility of dangerous actors compromising the system and decreasing belief within the wallets. If a CBDC protocol has been created and set for each KYC and anti-money laundering (AML) regulatory compliance, thresholds could possibly be constructed into wallets in order that if a pre-configured quantity is exceeded, the pockets might robotically flag the transaction for AML and additional checking. If the pockets has built-in clever parts, its software program might detect if a consumer makes common, smaller funds which are doubtlessly suspicious and set off AML notifications to the regulatory authorities.

Making wallets open-source makes them out there to all with out compromising privateness. Transferring limits could possibly be managed centrally in order that banks don’t have to set their every day switch restrict at an quantity, say, $15,000 per day. These limits could possibly be set on the CBDC degree or on the financial institution as an alternative of at every pockets. Setting limits centrally will be sure that wallets don’t want further complexity, and guidelines could be maintained equally for all. Privateness mechanisms resembling certificates could possibly be saved offline so funds might nonetheless occur, even with out on-line entry. Online payments might have built-in reference checks to ensure their validity, and all privateness certificates for wallets may have immutable and traceable data saved within the blockchain. With CBDCs, completely different wallets can be utilized to offer a view of funds on the financial institution and switching between wallets might be simple. This allows entry to funds from backup wallets in case entry to the first pockets turns into unavailable. In fact, this requires standardization throughout all wallets to make sure interoperability and the flexibility to simply switch funds to wallets created by completely different suppliers. If a supplier’s pockets goes offline for any purpose or in any other case turns into unavailable, customers ought to simply be capable of switch their funds to a special pockets. As cash is central to our lives and digital payments are an more and more widespread method of paying for items and companies by means of credit score and debit playing cards, it is smart to think about implementing a CBDC. A major requirement is that the core expertise on the coronary heart of the CBDC confirms with the governance necessities and that transactions are traceable and immutable. The BSV blockchain already ensures immutability and, with doubtlessly limitless scale, is primed to turn into the engine for CBDCs internationally.  Watch: CBDCs are extra than simply digital cash

Title: Pi Network: Accessible Mobile Mining or Security Concern? – Crypto News BTC
Date: Date not available
Content:
 
 Pi Network is a cryptocurrency venture launched in 2019 that permits customers to “mine” Pi coins from their smartphones. The community has seen immense success from customers drawn to its accessibility and ease of use, however the venture has raised questions on its safety and legitimacy. CCN’s newest report “Pi Network: Why Your Coins May Be Worthless” seeks to reply an important query: Is Pi Community a real alternative or a cleverly disguised phantasm? It examines three key facets: Funding potential, time dedication, and safety dangers. Developed by a bunch of Stanford graduates, Pi Community goals to create a extra inclusive and user-friendly method to cryptocurrency. Slightly than having to resolve advanced equations, individuals can faucet a button on a cell phone app to mine the system’s native token, often called PI. Nicolas Kokkalis, Chengdiao Fan, and Vince McPhillip of Stanford College based Pi Community in 2019. In accordance with the venture’s web site, it formally launched on March 14—the so-called Pi Day. The community permits customers to “mine” its native foreign money straight from their smartphones with out draining battery life or consuming extreme sources, in contrast to conventional cryptocurrency mining which requires excessive experience, specialised {hardware} and important quantities of electrical energy. Pi Community claims to be the primary platform to permit customers to mine straight from their smartphone, massively reducing the barrier to entry for crypto mining. Conventional mining, particularly for established cash like Bitcoin (BTC), requires highly effective computing rigs and important vitality consumption, making it impractical for the typical particular person. The community’s cell mining method permits anybody with a smartphone to take part. “We outline ‘mining’ extra broadly than its conventional that means equated to executing a proof-of-work consensus algorithm as in Bitcoin or Ethereum,” Pi mentioned in its white paper.  Nevertheless, some specialists consider that crypto mining is already well-defined, and Pi’s rebooted definition could possibly be used to serve its personal views. Pi adopts its consensus mechanism from Stellar’s Federated Byzantine Settlement, which is totally different from conventional Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) programs utilized by different cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s PoW requires miners to resolve advanced cryptographic puzzles, making certain safety by computational sources. Ethereum 2.0’s PoS depends on validators holding and staking cash to safe the community. Nevertheless, Pi’s ethos depends on customers creating belief circles by including individuals they know. This technique swaps out computational energy for trust-based quorums, the place nodes depend on the trustworthiness of their friends as an alternative of uncooked computational effort. When a enough variety of trusted nodes agree, the transaction is confirmed. Since Pi’s safety is determined by the integrity of private networks, there’s the chance that malicious actors may infiltrate or manipulate the community by creating pretend belief circles or convincing customers to validate them. Pi Networks’ know-your-customer (KYC) processes additionally elevate considerations, because it permits customers to behave as validators. This implies private identification info (PII) resembling names, addresses, and IDs, could possibly be dealt with by random people. Pi Community takes it a step even additional by making KYC obligatory for transferring tokens. Customers who full KYC can switch their balances to Mainnet, however they’re confined to Pi’s ecosystem. Over 12 million Pi’s customers are at present KYC-verified. The community additionally requests a myriad of permissions from its cell utility, together with entry to customers’ private info. Pi has been unavailable on the open marketplace for over 5 years because it was first introduced. The PI token is at present worth around $34 and isn’t publicly tradeable on any alternate.

Title: BTC mining profitability in free fall, noise complaints rise – Crypto News BTC
Date: Date not available
Content:
 
 BTC mining profitability continues to tumble regardless of the token’s value rising, whereas communities dwelling close to mining websites are shedding sleep and shedding persistence. JPMorgan (NASDAQ: JPM) analysts issued a report this week noting that block reward miners’ each day income and gross revenue each fell 6% in September, the third straight month of declines. This comes regardless of the fiat value of the BTC token having closed out the month of September a number of thousand {dollars} larger than its stage on the finish of August. And regardless of BTC’s average transaction fees spending a superb portion of September above their common charges in August, these charges accounted for less than ~5% of September’s block rewards. It appears particular person customers had been content material to take a seat on their utility-devoid tokens all through September, praying for an indication that each ‘quantity go up’ sign received’t be instantly adopted by a swift reversal. The average cost to mine a single BTC continues to outpace the block reward by a big sum, which explains why so many mining operators have begun ‘pivoting’ to serving as knowledge facilities for synthetic intelligence (AI) and different high-performance computing (HPC) duties.  Compounding issues, the devastation attributable to Hurricane Helene has knocked some U.S. mining operations offline. This week, CleanSpark noticed its shares tumble round 14% after Helene pressured lots of its mining websites in southeastern states to briefly shut down (partly to protect scarce electrical grid capability for extra urgent wants). CleanSpark issued an update on September 30 touting its efforts to convey most of those operations again on-line as quickly as attainable whereas reassuring traders that its mining infrastructure suffered “no materials harm” from Helene’s wrath. Final month, CleanSpark introduced the $5.8 million acquisition of two additional mining sites in Mississippi, and a $27.5 million deal for seven services in Tennessee. Each states had been impacted by Helene and will be anticipated to face comparable challenges sooner or later as local weather change—a few of which, paradoxically, is attributable to burning fossil fuels to fulfill excessive electrical energy calls for—continues to extend the depth of the annual hurricane season. Different Nasdaq-listed operators—together with Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT), Bitfarms (NASDAQ: BITF), Hut 8 (NASDAQ: HUT), Cipher Mining (NASDAQ: CIFR) and others—have additionally endured share value declines since final week, hit laborious by the triple whammy of reduced block rewards, pure disasters and rising unease over a attainable wider battle within the Center East. Purchase, purchase, purchase With BTC retail exercise exhibiting zero indicators of life, discovering a brand newraison d’être has turn out to be an obsession for miners, notably publicly traded U.S. companies that must persuade traders to not smash that ‘promote’ button. Some miners are deprioritizing mining BTC in favor of outright shopping for it, based mostly on their expectation that the ‘quantity go up’ will go up without end, so it’s only a matter of time till they’re within the black. MARA (NASDAQ: MARA), previously Marathon Digital, lately spent $249 million shopping for 4,144 BTC at a mean price of $59,500 (a sum that BTC threatened to sink beneath after tumbling Tuesday on geopolitical issues). On September 16, Canadian mining outfit Cathedra Bitcoin introduced a revised strategy centered on “repositioning the corporate away from the [BTC] mining enterprise, towards one with extra predictable money flows and which generates enticing returns on capital—growing and working knowledge facilities.”  Cathedra additionally plans to accumulate further BTC “by market purchases utilizing money circulation generated by our knowledge middle internet hosting operations,” in addition to “borrowing in opposition to stability sheet property … and utilizing the ensuing proceeds to accumulate extra [BTC].”  Cathedra particularly cited the instance set by MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), which has acquired nearly 245,000 BTC tokens over the previous couple of years by diluting its shares and taking over new debt. For this, Cathedra claims MicroStrategy has been “rewarded by fairness markets,” which is kind of like saying the Titanic was completely set to interrupt that trans-Atlantic velocity file till that iceberg obtained in its face. So, are the mining-abandoning miners just like the rats leaving a sinking ship? Or are they the canary within the BTC coal mine, signaling that everyone ought to GTFO earlier than it’s too late? Higher nonetheless, miners ought to change to supporting a blockchain that prioritizes utility over speculation, has a plan to transition from block rewards to transaction fees (as Satoshi meant), with a greener footprint in addition. Noise air pollution BTC miners have (rightfully) come below assault for the strains they placed on electrical energy grids merely to gasoline a speculative monetary exercise that advantages a handful of token-holders. However residents who stay adjoining to massive mining operations have further purpose to complain, given the disruption to their lives from the fixed noise generated by hundreds of mining rigs and the followers wanted to maintain the rigs cool. This backlash is a world phenomenon, as evidenced by the current shutdown of a mining operation in Norway after native residents in contrast the expertise to dwelling subsequent to a 24/7 sawmill. Final week, residents in Windom, Minnesota, celebrated after their protests satisfied Colorado-based miner internet hosting outfit Revolve Labs (previously Bit 49) to withdraw its permit to launch a mining facility simply outdoors Windom. A town meeting was held in August, at which many Windom residents cited issues over their property values declining because of the noise problem. They famous extreme noise complaints by residents of Glencoe, Minnesota, the positioning of an already energetic Revolve mining operation. Thus far, not one of the mitigating actions taken by Revolve have proved adequate to scale back the noise to ranges that Glencoe locals discover acceptable. Revolve’s COO Cody Nelson didn’t assist his trigger by claiming {that a} native couple who protested the Glencoe operation had been “making noise as a result of they assume we make some huge cash they usually assume they’ll get one thing out of it by preventing us.” Nelson added that the noise mitigation efforts Revolve had taken had been “costly” and the corporate “received’t be doing any extra” mitigation as a result of “it might be cheaper to purchase [the couple’s] home.” Regardless of these blowups, Revolve is now urgent the Glencoe Financial Improvement Authority (EDA) to build a new combination mining facility and AI data center early subsequent yr. The plans name for some liquid-cooled rigs that might cut back a number of the noise emanating from the power, however some EDA officers try to nudge the positioning of Revolve’s new growth additional off the crushed path to keep away from future conflicts. Godless commies making an excessive amount of noise Down in Arkansas, the NewRays mining agency has filed a federal suit in opposition to native officers in Faulkner County for pursuing an unjust prosecution to close down its native mining operation. NewRays bought land in Faulkner County in October 2022 and shortly started growing its mining facility. NewRays alleges that by June 2023, Faulkner County officers had begun plotting in opposition to NewRays, partly as a consequence of residents’ noise complaints but in addition “due to the group’s notion of ‘international involvement’ in its operations.” The ‘international involvement’ issues allegedly stemmed from “widespread anti-Chinese language sentiment” within the county on the time. This included the distribution of “a number of anti-Chinese language newsletters” with titles resembling How the Communist Chinese language are Hijacking America, Domestically and Energy Corporations Subsidizing Communist China Gamers! The go well with quotes Faulkner County Lawyer Phil Murphy telling a public assembly there was little the County may legally do concerning the international involvement. Nonetheless, they may “create a land use planning ordinance. We will create an ordinance that offers with issues that we will measure like sound, so these are points which were upheld for years.” The end result was Ordinance 23-20, which restricted most decibel output to 60dB between 8am to 8pm and 55dB between 8pm to 8am. Violators would face felony costs, regardless of NewRays’ competition that the County lacks the authority to impose felony sanctions with out a corresponding state statute. As such, 23-20 “facially discriminates in opposition to knowledge facilities and cryptocurrency mining operations,” and NewRays particularly. Living proof: in July 2023, Maree Coats, a magistrate who acted as “main sponsor” of 23-20, informed a public assembly that “I need to vote to place [NewRays’] again in opposition to the wall.” Mere days after 23-20 took impact, a bunch of native residents filed a civil complaint in opposition to NewRays, claiming that the noise emanating from the mining operation had made life “insupportable.” NewRays tried to shift the grievance to federal court docket, however the county’s circuit court docket claimed jurisdiction, main NewRays to file go well with in opposition to the officers it deems accountable for the brouhaha. It’s not straightforward scamming Inexperienced Lastly, final week noticed a U.S. federal choose rule that the civil grievance filed final yr in opposition to Inexperienced United LLC by the Securities and Alternate Fee (SEC) can proceed to trial. In March 2023, the SEC accused the Utah-based Inexperienced United of defrauding $18 million from ‘investors’ who’d been swindled into investing in so-called ‘Inexperienced Bins’ and ‘Inexperienced Nodes’ that allegedly mined a token known as (anticipate it) GREEN. Inexperienced United founders Kristoffer Krohn and Wright Thurston claimed that they’d keep the machines and dispense newly mined GREEN tokens to traders as they turn out to be accessible. However there by no means had been any ‘Inexperienced Bins’ and the nugatory GREEN tokens Krohn and Thurston allotted had been minted multi functional go shortly after they raised tens of millions from traders. The SEC alleged that the pair used the funds to purchase BTC mining rigs and stored the BTC tokens they mined for their very own use. On September 23, the U.S. District Courtroom for the District of Utah, Central Division rejected the defendants’ bids to dismiss the go well with, which largely hinged on the defendants’ claims that the SEC had did not show the existence of an funding contract between themselves and their traders/marks. Underneath the Howey test, such contracts are key to figuring out whether or not a transaction entails a safety that falls below the SEC’s purview. The ruling by U.S. District Choose Ann Marie McIff Allen discovered that the SEC “has sufficiently alleged a safety within the type of Inexperienced Bins (pc {hardware}) coupled with a internet hosting settlement to function the Inexperienced Bins.” The ruling additionally discovered that Howey’s ‘frequent enterprise’ standards is greater than evident given wording that “all traders share, proportionally, within the earnings of the enterprise consisting of the collectively managed Inexperienced Bins.” The defendants’ assertion that traders may earn “100%+ ROIs” and that Inexperienced United can be “doing all of the work” to generate that return equally triggers Howey’s ‘expectation of earnings’ and ‘from the efforts of others’ standards. As for the fraud angle, the choose basically mentioned ‘hell, sure’ to the SEC’s assertions that the defendants had been stone-cold scammers. And as for the defendants’ claims that their constitutional rights had been violated as a result of the SEC is badly asserting authority in “some new enviornment,” the choose mainly mentioned ‘STFU’ and we’ll see you in court docket.

Title: Bitcoin's Future: Global Liquidity Reaches 2022 Levels
Date: Date not available
Content:
The Currency analytics 
Cryptocurrency News – REAL News ® – TCAT  Bitcoin (BTC) is on a trajectory that suggests higher prices in the near future, driven by a notable increase in global liquidity and favorable macroeconomic trends. With liquidity rising by 0.92% to $132.8 trillion—marking its highest levels since early 2022—Bitcoin stands to benefit significantly from these developments.  Recent actions from central banks around the world have contributed to this surge in liquidity. Notably, the People’s Bank of China has implemented measures to improve collateral values, creating a more favorable environment for financial assets. This burgeoning liquidity not only enhances the financial landscape but also positions Bitcoin as a primary hedge against monetary inflation, akin to gold. With rising liquidity often correlating with increased investment in risk assets, the cryptocurrency market could see substantial gains. Bitcoin’s recent price movement illustrates its resilience and responsiveness to these liquidity trends. Currently trading at around $66,000, BTC recently bounced off a crucial 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. This level has historically served as a reliable indicator for both upward and downward price movements throughout the year. The fact that Bitcoin is respecting this Fibonacci level suggests it remains in tune with broader liquidity trends. As global liquidity continues to rise, analysts expect Bitcoin to breach its next major target: new highs above $66,700. September 2024 proved to be a landmark month for Bitcoin, closing with a 7.35% increase—the best-performing September in the cryptocurrency’s history. This bullish sentiment is underpinned by Bitcoin’s ability to weather recent market corrections while maintaining upward momentum. Despite prevailing market expectations that a downturn was imminent, predictive models from Spot On Chain indicated a strong likelihood of continued gains. Their analysis shows a 69% chance of Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high this month and a 54% chance of BTC hitting the $100,000 mark by year-end. The favorable macroeconomic climate significantly influences Bitcoin’s prospects. As the Federal Reserve pivots its focus from inflation control to employment metrics, analysts are closely monitoring upcoming U.S. unemployment data. Should this data indicate lower unemployment rates than anticipated, it could increase the probability of a 50 basis point rate cut in November to 42%. Historically, rate cuts are seen as beneficial for risk assets, including Bitcoin. When the cost of borrowing decreases, more capital typically flows into higher-risk investments, leading to price appreciation in assets like BTC. As Bitcoin’s price begins to climb, emerging liquidity clusters are critical to watch. Recent price retracements to $63,225 have allowed Bitcoin to absorb liquidity, setting the stage for its next upward move. Key liquidity clusters that traders should monitor include: These price levels will play a crucial role in determining Bitcoin’s future trajectory. Sustained trading above the high-liquidity clusters could trigger further bullish activity, while any dips toward support clusters would need to be carefully managed to prevent significant declines. In addition to macroeconomic and liquidity factors, Bitcoin is exhibiting bullish technical patterns that further support the notion of a price surge. As it continues to maintain support at critical Fibonacci levels and demonstrates a willingness to move higher, market analysts remain optimistic. In particular, the upward trend is being driven by increasing interest from both retail and institutional investors. This growing enthusiasm is bolstered by Bitcoin’s status as a digital gold and its potential to serve as a hedge against inflationary pressures. As we move into the final quarter of 2024, Bitcoin’s outlook remains bright, buoyed by rising global liquidity and supportive macroeconomic conditions. If Bitcoin can sustain its current momentum and break through key resistance levels, it could unlock significant upside potential. The intersection of rising liquidity, favorable market sentiment, and robust technical indicators makes a compelling case for Bitcoin to reach new price highs. Market participants will be closely monitoring liquidity clusters and upcoming economic data as these factors could serve as catalysts for Bitcoin’s next moves. With global liquidity reaching its highest levels since 2022 and a series of positive indicators on the horizon, Bitcoin appears well-positioned for a price surge. The combination of supportive macroeconomic conditions, liquidity trends, and bullish technical patterns sets the stage for potentially higher prices. Investors and traders should keep an eye on key liquidity levels and upcoming economic reports as these will be instrumental in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory. The final quarter of the year could prove to be a pivotal time for BTC, as it aims to capitalize on these favorable conditions to reach new heights. As always, prudent risk management and staying informed about market dynamics will be essential for navigating this rapidly evolving landscape.
