Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has increased its Bitcoin holdings to over 700 BTC after its latest acquisition of the top crypto asset. On Oct. 11, Metaplanet confirmed the purchase of an additional 108.999 BTC for ¥1 billion. The firm acquired the Bitcoin at an average price of ¥9.17 million, roughly $61,659. This marks Metaplanet’s third Bitcoin purchase in October, bringing its total holdings to 748.502 BTC, valued at ¥6.965 billion or $46.8 million. On Oct. 1, the firm purchased 107.91 BTC for around $7 million and later earned a 23.97 BTC premium by selling 233 BTC put options on Oct. 3. Fast-forward to Oct. 7, and the firm also acquired an additional 108.786 BTC for ¥1 billion, equivalent to about $6.7 million. Metaplanet revealed its average price for all of its Bitcoin is ¥9.3 million, approximately $62,504 per BTC. So, with Bitcoin’s current trading at around $60,600, the firm is currently facing a slight loss of around $1,900 on each of its Bitcoins. Despite this, the acquisition has influenced Metaplanet’s stock performance. According to Google Finance data, the company’s stock has risen by around 500% on the year-to-date metrics. Meanwhile, Metaplanet’s aggressive buying strategy positions it as a leading Bitcoin holder in Asia. Notably, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich recently revealed the company’s goal of accumulating at least 1,000 BTC for its reserves. So, if it continues at this pace, it could surpass Hong Kong-based Meitu Inc., which holds 940.9 BTC, to become the largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder in the region.

Title: Bitcoin (BTC) Has Only 14 Days Left to Avoid 'Longest Sideways' Ever, Analyst Says
Date: Date not available
Content:
Alarming CPI data and new legal challenges yet again prevented Bitcoin (BTC) from entering the bull market. Should it spend two more weeks in limbo, BTC's performance might end in a situation that has never been seen before, according to CryptoQuant's founder. Bitcoin (BTC) is on its way to scoring its longest sideways phase in halving years ever. Starting from today, it has only 14 days left to follow the pattern registered after previous halvings. Should history repeat itself, Bitcoin (BTC) has only two weeks left to start surging fast, as demonstrated by CryptoQuant's founder and CEO Ki Young Ju. 285 days have passed in 2024. If there is no #Bitcoin bull market within the next 14 days, this will mark the longest sideways in a halving year in history. pic.twitter.com/JWHkgHC27C Today, Bitcoin (BTC) is 285 days into 2024. During every previous halving year, the largest cryptocurrency was already in the parabolic phase of its growth. Bitcoin (BTC) halving is a periodical event on the oldest blockchain that marks a 50% reduction of the issuance of new Bitcoins. In 2024, the metric dropped from 6.25 Bitcoins (BTC) per block to 3,125 Bitcoins (BTC) per block. Bitcoin (BTC) halvings (or halvenings) happen once every four years; previous events took place in 2012, 2016 and 2020. Typically, having is interpreted as the most powerful macro monetary catalyst for Bitcoin's (BTC) price, as it makes the asset programmably scarcer. In previous cycles, Bitcoin (BTC) was setting new all-time highs in the years that followed halving events. However, this time, the picture looks different: Bitcoin (BTC) remains sideways for too long, which is alarming for bulls. As covered by U.Today previously, such a weakness is interpreted by top trader Peter Brandt as a possible signal for a 75% crash coming.

Election 2024 coverage presented by This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day. CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,908.58 +1.34% Bitcoin (BTC): $61,001.69 -0.04% Ether (ETH): $2,410.36 +0.74% S&P 500: 5,780.05 -0.21% Gold: $2,640.19 +0.28% Nikkei 225: 39,605.80 +0.57% Following its 4% slide during U.S. hours on Thursday, bitcoin regained some ground to trade above $61,000 on Friday. BTC fell to $59,000 following a U.S. CPI report that showed hotter-than-expected inflation in September, seemingly putting paid to hopes of another 50 basis-point interest-rate cut by the Fed next month. The bounce left BTC about 0.25% higher than 24 hours ago. The broader digital asset market showed stronger gains of 1.65%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. XRP and DOGE led the way, adding around 2.5% and 2% respectively. Donald Trump's odds of a return to the White House surged to a more than two-month high on Polymarket. Traders are giving the former president a 55.8% shot versus Vice President Kamala Harris' 43.8% on the prediction market site, where more than $1.6 billion has been wagered on the November election. Trump's chances have risen to levels last seen days after President Joe Biden said he wouldn't seek reelection, clearing the way for Harris to take over. Another prediction market, Kalshi, which just recently won permission to list contracts based on U.S. elections, also shows Trump in the lead over Harris: 52% to 48%. Crypto exchange Bitnomial filed suit against the SEC, saying the regulator overextended its jurisdiction in seeking to regulate a proposed XRP futures contract together with the CFTC. In a Thursday filing with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the company said the futures fall solely in the CFTC's remit and the SEC's involvement would add significantly to the company's regulatory burden. The exchange self-certified that the XRP futures did not violate the CFTC's regulations on Aug. 9, it said. "Bitnomial disagrees with the SEC’s view that XRP is an investment contract and, therefore, a security, and that XRP Futures are thus security futures," it said in the filing. - Omkar Godbole Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Title: Bitcoin Primed To Explode by Over 120%, According to Veteran Trader Peter Brandt – Here’s the Timeline - The Daily Hodl
Date: Date not available
Content:
Seasoned trader Peter Brandt is leaning bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) as the flagship crypto asset lingers around 17% below the all-time high. Brandt tells his 741,800 followers on the social media platform X that his price target for Bitcoin is $135,000, a level he sees being reached in either August or September of 2025. According to Brandt, Bitcoin typically records massive gains during the second half of the halving cycles. On what could invalidate his bullish thesis for the crypto king, the veteran trader says, “Close below $48,000 negates my chart analysis.” Bitcoin is trading at $61,070 at time of writing. The seasoned trader also says that Bitcoin is outperforming gold as a store of value. Brandt notes how based on Bayesian analysis, a tool used to compute probabilities for a hypothesis as more data is obtained, the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio could remain above 100 once the three-figure threshold is crossed. “Bitcoin or Gold / BTC vs XAU
Which is king of the store of value story?
-Bitcoin is kicking Gold’s arse
-Resistance at 32 to 1
-Currently at 23 to 1
-Support in high teens to 1
-New ATH sets target at 100+ to 1
-Bayesian analysis at 30% that market rolling over for good” Brandt’s bullish stance on Bitcoin is similar to that of the co-founders of blockchain analytics platform Glassnode. Earlier this week, Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who go by the handle Negentropic on the social media platform X, said a correction which saw Bitcoin drop from around $66,500 to slightly below $60,000 amid tensions in the Middle East would be short-lived. “Last week’s geopolitical risks led to a Bitcoin correction, but fundamentals strengthened regardless. This positive shift is driven by network growth and rising liquidity. The BTC move up is just starting.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox

Title: History Suggests Bitcoin Will Not Close October Negative
Date: October 11, 2024
Content:
[ccpw id="39382"] Date:  Written By:   Follow Us On Crypto analyst Rekt Capital maintains that Bitcoin will not close in the red in October, citing its historical performance. The month of October has shockingly come with surprises as regards price expectations from the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Bitcoin is currently on a 3.78% price deficit from its closing price in September. Bitcoin proponents were further stunned when the premier crypto asset dropped to a 3-week price low on Thursday. For context, Bitcoin fell to $58,900 yesterday, a price it last saw in mid-September. Amid the swelling doubts among market participants regarding October’s outturn, crypto analyst Rekt Capital has assured that the month will not close negatively. In a tweet yesterday, Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin has historically closed in the red twice in October. Bitcoin closed on a deficit in October 2014 and 2018, posting negative outturns of 12.95% and 3.83%, respectively. Rekt Capital noted that these adverse closings were due to the crypto winter seen in those years after a bull cycle. For context, Bitcoin closed with a yearly deficit of 11.39% in 2014 while consolidating from the bull cycle peak at $1,242 in November 2013. Also, the digital asset closed 2018 at a 73.48% loss after a similar cycle that saw it reach a new high of $19,785 in December 2017. Consequently, Rekt Capital stated the crypto market is currently not in a bearish cycle, as the April Bitcoin halving has historically ushered in bullish runs. Hence, he was increasingly confident that Bitcoin would not defy past patterns and close at a loss this month. Notably, Bitcoin’s October performance backs the analyst’s claims. In the years the halving event occurred, Bitcoin surged in double figures on the tenth month. For instance, it respectively appreciated 14.71% and 27.7% in 2016 and 2020. Furthermore, historical data on Bitcoin’s performance in September has added to the optimism that the largest cryptocurrency will not close in the red this month. Notably, Bitcoin recorded an average 25% upsurge in October, when the preceding month closed positively. In the past twelve years, Bitcoin surged 33.49%, 14.71%, and 28.52% in October, when September closed positively. The premier crypto asset recorded these monthly gains in 2015, 2016, and 2023, respectively, and analysts expect nothing different this month. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has shown signs of life in the past 24 hours after the dip, rebounding to $61,503 at the time of writing. Market expert Mike Alfred suggested that Bitcoin may have bottomed, as favorable macroeconomic metrics point to a continued recovery.

Title: Crypto Edges Towards Mass Adoption With SEC Approval Of Options For BTC ETFs
Date: Oct 9, 2024,
Content:
Crypto Bitcoin Approval  - ETF -US. SEC - Photo Illustration 2024 has been the year of improving trust and investor confidence in crypto with the SEC approval and launch of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) for spot bitcoin (BTC) followed by ether (ETH). The AUM for spot BTC ETFs has the crossed the $50 billion mark in less than a year as both retail and institutional investors adopted this instrument for exposure to crypto. According to data from CoinGlass, spot BTC ETFs have delivered mostly positive net inflows since their launch. Total Bitcoin Spot ETF Net Inflow (USD)  Unique Divine, ceo of Nibiru, says, “The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in January ended a decade-long wait. Billions in institutional inflows followed. This was only the beginning." Because bitcoin is a volatile asset, and regulatory concerns remain, several TradFi players, especially smaller ones, do not deal directly in spot ETFs. This is one of the remaining barriers to crypto and spot ETFs achieving critical mass. The SEC's approval of Options on spot BTC ETFs is a key positive development towards fostering greater adoption, though arguably not as accelerated as the SEC claimed in its filing on September 20. In the SEC’s view, the move will, “help investors to hedge their positions and manage crypto-related risk.” When BTC ETF Options go live following the CFTC and OCC approvals, it will be the first regulated leverage tool for one of the world’s most decentralized and supply-constrained commodities. Though bitcoin’s non-custodial, deflationary store of value narrative has gained considerable strength over the years, it has so far been unable to capitalize on the liquidity boost that synthetic leverage enables. Institutions have mostly remained on the sidelines given excessive counterparty risks and lack of redress mechanisms. Retail investors have to rely heavily on inefficient, perpetual or "perps" based instruments for leverage. As Rich Rines, Core DAO contributor, highlights, "Following the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, the traditional financial world has been searching for more flexible ways to engage with bitcoin. "Options are one of the first ways traditional institutions can increase exposure, manage risks, and generate income with Bitcoin. Once institutions can earn yield via Bitcoin ETFs, options will be an invaluable tool in the toolbelt for sophisticated traditional institutions." The prospect of securing longer-term incentives for stakeholders to move beyond speculation with mote sophisticated hedging tools is one of the biggest anticipated benefits of the Options approval. Adds Nibiru, " With each step forward, momentum is built, driving the SEC’s approval of Ethereum ETFs in July. Now, we’re on the cusp of a new era. Digital assets, once fringe, are evolving into regulated investment vehicles. Accessible. Mainstream. For everyone.” Spot BTC ETF Options might be the first, but they surely won’t be the last. ETH ETFs, and possibly even SOL or other altcoin ETFs in the future, will inevitably get Options-based instruments in some capacity sooner or later. Against this backdrop, the approval of BTC ETF Options will further contribute to the virtuous feedback loop where more trust brings more liquidity into the space, which further improves trust and demand for a wide range of secondary products. Abhitej Singh, founder of Filament Finance, notes, “Given their time aspect, among other factors, Options provide a solid foundation for all kinds of financial derivatives, which can be a massive value unlock in the context of DeFi. "With products like defined-outcome ETFs, premium income funds, tail risk ETFs, etc., bitcoin holders will now get loads of opportunities to use their bitcoin to generate value without selling them." Generating passive or low-risk income of BTC is an important factor in boosting the asset’s utilization ratio, which is currently as low as 0.2 percent according to Grayscale. The launch of Options will help catalyze the move that spot ETFs have already started. It represents a trillion-dollar opportunity, but more importantly, strengthening bitcoin’s value proposition will inevitably improve crypto’s value proposition through greater competition, the trickle-down effect, and market rotation. Alongside other bullish macro-economic and regulatory developments like the Fed’s much-awaited rate cut signaling the easing cycle and the Bank of New York's market entry as a bitcoin custodian for ETF providers, the approval of Options on spot ETFs marks another milestone for crypto’s journey to mass retail. While this is likely to produce net positive results, it’s also helps to ensure that crypto’s foundational values and principles remain intact in the face of increasing institutional participation. Shibtoshi, founder of SilentSwap, says, “Institutional participation and political attention are welcome from a business and growth standpoint, but now is also the time to hold crypto’s core vision in high regard. The goal is to build decentralized, community-oriented tools with institution-level security and stability. Otherwise, it won’t be long before crypto’s fate becomes the same as Web2’s.” Adds Paxful ceo, Roshan Dharia, “Publicly traded bitcoin options are a vital tool for the maturing cryptocurrency market, offering both hedging opportunities and greater price discovery. "We see these instruments as part of a larger ecosystem that enhances liquidity and provides institutional and retail investors alike more sophisticated strategies for managing risk. We believe these advancements ultimately strengthen the market, making crypto a more attractive, stable, and robust asset class globally.” For the BTC or crypto-backed financial ecosystem to realize its potential, it’s important not to lose sight of the broader mission amidst this period of institutional validation and greater retail adoption. The endgame is a more holistic financial ecosystem for investors to easily access the benefits of the decentralization of finance, and new opportunities for yield, with the convenience, seamlessness, and protections offered in many of today's regulated financial markets. Spot BTC ETF Options offer another instrument to move the industry forward in this direction. Whether they will, remains to be seen.  One Community.

With the volatility in the price of Bitcoin (BTC), different metrics now play a key role in judging what traders should expect next. One invaluable tool during this period remains Coinbase Premium, a metric that clearly defines the two extremes of Bitcoin's price. CryptoQuant Founder Ki Young Ju mapped out these two extreme price levels for the coin in his recent post on X. Coinbase Premium is a metric that tracks the price difference of Bitcoin between Coinbase Pro (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair). According to Young Ju, Bitcoin has moved sideways since March.

Coinbase Premium Sends Super-Rare Bullish Signal for BTC
Vladislav Sopov


 Based on this, Coinbase Premium showed large differences at $53,000 and $72,000. At these two points, Bitcoin whales bought the coin in the upper range while selling it for $53,000. In a contrary move, whales on global exchanges blocked an ATH breakout and defended $53,000, establishing a key support level. According to the CryptoQuant founder, this trend, though defined, may benefit much more from a near-zero premium and may act as a support or resistance level. With the guidance range in view, Bitcoin traders can now proactively watch out for changes in trends. The price of Bitcoin has returned to $60,800 after plunging as low as $58,895.21 over the past 24 hours. As of writing, the coin is now changing hands for $60,842.81, up 0.3%, as trading volume jumped 9.36% to $30.23 billion.

Bitcoin Reacts to Hotter-Than-Expected Inflation Data
Alex Dovbnya


 There is mixed sentiment regarding the price of Bitcoin. Despite the recovery, there are still expectations that the coin may slip back to the $58,000 range as volatility is sustained. Peter Brandt also backs this pessimism. Nonetheless, Bitcoin is known to remain resilient during times of uncertainty like this. While traders are bracing for this potential slip, some are still focusing on the optimism of leaders like Michael Saylor. Godfrey Benjamin is an experienced crypto journalist whose main goal is to educate everyone around him about the prospects of Web 3.0. His love for crypto was birthed when, as a former banker, he discovered the obvious advantages of decentralized money over traditional payments. With his vast experience covering various aspects of Web3, Godfrey's articles has been featured on Blockchain.news, Cryptonews and Coingape, among others.

Title: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Tumbles Below $59K Amid Inflation Worry, SEC Lawsuit
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by Cryptocurrencies continue to face headwinds on a number of fronts, with Thursday bringing a faster-than-hoped inflation report for September and yet another U.S. government regulatory action against a sector participant. In mid-afternoon U.S. trading, bitcoin (BTC) was lower by about 4% over the past 24 hours. At $59,000, the price has returned to levels not seen since the U.S. Federal Reserve unexpectedly slashed its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in mid-September. Altcoins outperformed somewhat, with the broad-based crypto benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index declining just under 3% during the same period. Ether (ETH) dropped 3.5%, while only decentralized exchange Uniswaps's token (UNI) had positive return during the day on news about the platform's own layer-2 plans. Crypto began the day on a weak foot after the U.S. Consumer Price Index report showed an unexpected re-acceleration of inflation in September. The news seemingly drove a stake through any idea that the Fed could cut interest rates another 50 basis points in November, with some market participants now wondering if the U.S. central bank might even decide to pause its rate-cutting cycle at that meeting. "Hot CPI and oil price spike due to Middle East tensions have created a fear that the Fed will not cut as much as the market previously thought," Quinn Thompson, founder of hedge fund Lekker Capital, said in a Telegram message. "Mix in [Atlanta Fed President] Bostic's hawkish comments today regarding a potential pause and that's the tinder to run the levered traders' stops." Indeed, the sell-off liquidated some $147 million of leveraged long positions betting on higher prices across crypto derivatives markets, CoinGlass data shows. Prices dived even lower during afternoon hours following news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued major digital asset market maker Cumberland DRW, raising concerns once again about the challenging regulatory environment for U.S. crypto firms. The SEC alleged DRW traded crypto assets that were sold as securities without registering as a securities dealer. Cumberland pushed back against the lawsuit in an X post, saying that "we are not making any changes to our business operations or the assets in which we provide liquidity as a result of this action by the SEC." The SEC lawsuit was only the latest regulatory action by the U.S. government against crytpo this week. On Wednesday, the Department of Justice charged four market makers and more than a dozen individuals over market manipulation charges. Also Wednesday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler was very dismissive about the idea that bitcoin or crypto might catch on in any sort of significant way as a means of payment. He called out the crypto industry for being filled with "fraudsters," and asserted that the "leading lights" of the sector were either in jail or soon to be on their way behind bars. "There's going to be a lot of noise between now and [the U.S.] election [in November] and it's likely bitcoin is just range bound until then," Lekker's Thompson added.

Title: Bitcoin Dips Below $59,000 as Inflation Fears Rattle Investors | CoinMarketCap
Date: Date not available
Content:
Bitcoin (BTC) slumped this week, losing 5.3% to a three-week low of $58,900. The bearish feeling further came as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw consecutive outflows of $59 million on Oct. 8-9. Reversals from the recent inflow sequence suggest weakening investor confidence in near-term price prospects. If that weren't enough, the SEC also filed a complaint against Cumberland, a leading market maker, for allegedly acting as an "unregistered dealer" in swaps of cryptocurrencies. That only poured more fuel on the fire of uncertainty in an already skittish market. The cautious outlook is finding its reflection in derivatives markets. The premium on Bitcoin futures, which usually keeps a 5-10% annualized rate in neutral markets, has fallen below the threshold of 5% for the first time in more than two months. That change also replicates a similar bearish pivot in August that preceded a spectacular 24.6% price plunge over three days. Observer of crypto markets and writer of all things crypto.

Title: Will 2024 Close with Bitcoin (BTC) Above $120,000? Top 3 Cryptos to Add to Your Portfolio Now
Date: 11 Oct 2024, 9:16 am
Content:
As we enter the latter months of 2024, Bitcoin (BTC) is once more the focus, with projections pointing to a likely leap above $120,000. Standard Chartered, a significant financial institute, thinks that BTC may rise considerably more if the current geopolitical and economic circumstances line up nicely. Though Bitcoin dominates the news, wise investors are also looking at other appealing cryptocurrencies that can yield notable profits alongside BTC. Three cryptocurrencies worth monitoring as we head into 2025 are XRP, Ethereum (ETH), and Rexas Finance (RXS). Standard Chartered's recent analysis suggests that by 2024, Bitcoin might reach $120,000. This prediction is based on a mix of elements, including a continuing dropping supply of Bitcoin coming from miner hoarding and investor hope about a likely U.S. presidential election victory for pro-crypto politicians. Middle Eastern geopolitics also strongly imply that investors would flee into Bitcoin, driving its price upward. Should these elements hold, BTC is not unlikely to rise above the $120,000 mark. Still, Bitcoin's success will rely on the economy's more significant state. A 25-basis-point interest rate drop projected by the Federal Reserve in November could be a substantial driver of BTC's ascent since it would probably encourage more investment in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Should this happen, Bitcoin is most certainly going to surpass the $120,000 limit, therefore proving its supremacy in the market. Though it dropped from its highs earlier in the year, Ethereum has since been trading around $2,346; analysts think it is now in a major buying zone. Ethereum's foundations are still solid; its smart contract features and decentralized apps generate notable network activity. Ethereum's prominence in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and enterprise blockchain solutions could grow as we head toward 2025, therefore positioning ETH for significant gains. Should Ethereum be able to stay above the $2,252 support zone, it may witness a surge short-term beyond $3,000. With network development and daily active addresses almost doubling in the past two weeks, analysts from CoinGape have noted that investor interest has skyrocketed. This implies that underprivileged purchasers are getting ready for a powerful comeback, which would enable Ethereum to surpass essential resistance levels and provide the conditions for a positive fourth quarter. Ethereum is undoubtedly a must-have for any diversified crypto portfolio with its colossal ecosystem and ongoing network enhancements. XRP has had a difficult year as continuous legal disputes with the SEC cloud its price performance. Currently trading at $0.54, XRP has dropped significantly after the SEC decided to appeal Judge Torres's order declaring XRP sales on public markets do not constitute securities transactions. Although XRP's price has suffered from this regulatory ambiguity, analysts remain cautiously hopeful about its long-term viability. With collaborations in the UK, Europe, and the Middle East increasing XRP's usage in cross-border payments and tokenized assets, Ripple's worldwide utility is expanding. Through a partnership with Clear Junction, Ripple recently increased its payment options and obtained in-principle approval from Dubai to provide end-to-end payment solutions in the United Arab Emirates. Notwithstanding the legal challenges XRP faces in the United States, these events are projected to boost its acceptance in important financial markets, thereby maybe propelling its price toward $1 by year's end. Although Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are well-known behemoths, Rexas Finance (RXS presents a special chance for investors trying to profit from the rising trend of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Using fractional ownership of assets via blockchain technology, Rexas Finance is aiming at trillion-dollar sectors, including real estate and commodities. This method democratizes access to high-value assets so that anyone might possess a small portion of luxury real estate or costly goods. With Stage 3 sold out ahead of time and generating $2.75 million, the RXS presale has been an absolute triumph. At $0.06 right now, the cryptocurrency is valued by analysts as having a notable price increase once it is published on big exchanges. Rexas Finance has purposefully steered clear of venture capital support in order to stay dispersed and oriented on long-term expansion. The platform is positioned to take the front stage in the RWA market with its creative features, like the Rexas Token Builder and Rexas Estate. Every forward-looking portfolio should include RXS since analysts estimate gains of up to 10X in the next years. Investors all across are drawn to Bitcoin's possible explosive rise to $120,000 as the end of 2024 draws near. Still, it's crucial not to discount other highly promising tokens such as XRP, Ethereum, and Rexas Finance. These three cryptocurrencies present unique value propositions that might yield significant profits not too distant. Now is the time for individuals wishing to diversify their holdings to take into account these tokens alongside Bitcoin to optimize possible returns as we enter 2025.

Title: 285 Days Into 2024: Top Analyst Warns Bitcoin Bull Market Must Arrive in 14 Days to Avoid Longest Halving Year Sideways Trend
Date: October 11, 2024
Content:
[ccpw id="39382"] Date:  Written By:   Follow Us On Bitcoin is on the verge of facing its longest sideways movement in a halving year, with no new ATH in over 30 weeks. Bitcoin’s price movement during the 2024 halving cycle has triggered attention due to its extended sideways trend. Ki Young Ju, CEO and founder of CryptoQuant, points out that if a bull market does not emerge within the next 14 days, Bitcoin will experience its longest period of sideways movement in a halving year.  285 days have passed in 2024. If there is no #Bitcoin bull market within the next 14 days, this will mark the longest sideways in a halving year in history. pic.twitter.com/JWHkgHC27C — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) October 11, 2024  Historically, this point in previous halving cycles has shown signs of strong upward growth, but 2024’s cycle deviates from the historical trend. This unusual performance raises questions about whether the expected bull run will occur or continue to be delayed. Per Young Ju’s chart, in the 2024 halving cycle, Bitcoin’s return index remains relatively flat, hovering just below a 1.5x cumulative return.  Compared to previous cycles, the growth is notably slower, with no significant upward trend emerging. At this stage, in prior halving years, Bitcoin typically experienced stronger price performance.  For instance, the 2020 halving cycle saw Bitcoin’s return multiple reach close to 4x by this point in the year, signaling the start of a major bull run. However, the current cycle has shown limited movement, leading to concerns about whether Bitcoin will follow its historical upward trajectory. This update follows veteran trader Peter Brandt’s analysis of the implications of Bitcoin’s recent struggle to breach its all-time high (ATH). According to Brandt, Bitcoin has not set a new ATH in 30 weeks, a pattern that often precedes a market decline.  If this trend continues, Bitcoin could face a major correction, with the possibility of a 75% collapse. Bitcoin’s current price hovers near its 8-week simple moving average of $60,998, reflecting ongoing uncertainty in the market. While Bitcoin faces short-term challenges, its long-term strength compared to gold remains noteworthy. Brandt’s analysis of the BTC/GLD ratio highlights Bitcoin’s consistent outperformance of gold in recent years.  However, Bitcoin is nearing a resistance level at 32 oz of gold, a key threshold that could determine its future trajectory. If Bitcoin can surpass this resistance, its value could surge, with potential targets exceeding 100 oz per Bitcoin.  Disclaimer: This content is informational and should not be considered financial advice.

Title: Bitcoin at key psychological level: Will BTC's history trigger a rally? - AMBCrypto
Date: October 11, 2024
Content:
Bitcoin nears critical support level, signaling potential rally amid positive social sentiment.  Bitcoin [BTC] remains the leading asset in the digital space, offering opportunities for traders and investors aiming for long-term gains. Bitcoin is at a critical psychological turning point, a pivotal range based on historical data from CryptoQuant. This key price zone often acts as a zone where traders’ optimism or pessimism emerges, depending on profitability. Currently, the market suggests an upward trend, but a drop below this zone could trigger a shift in sentiment.  The historical data indicates when Bitcoin prices stayed within this range as it is doing, the market continued its upward trend, supporting the idea of a price increase. Source: CryptoQuant Analyzing the market further, the chart indicates that Bitcoin holders are mostly in “HODL” mode, showing confidence despite volatility. There’s a possibility of a significant sell-off, causing a temporary drop then a major rally to restart profit-taking behaviors. Bitcoin holders, especially those with coins older than six months, remain dormant indicating confidence in a rally. Source: Checkonchain However, a minor dip could push BTC towards the $60K level, where it may bottom out and reverse, signaling that a rally is likely soon. The price action shows that Bitcoin continues to test lower levels in its current downward trend. BTC is expected to hold this level, but any corrections driven by negative market sentiment (FUD) may push the price below $60K before it rebounds. Combining this with technical indicators, the outlook for a rally remains strong as Bitcoin consolidates within its support range, preparing for a potential surge. Source: X Finally, social sentiment plays a vital role in Bitcoin’s price movement. Public opinion and community engagement influence market activity, and Bitcoin’s social sentiment recently hit its highest level since the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. This spike could be connected to recent speculation about Bitcoin’s creator, further fueling public interest. The positive social sentiment, combined with a low social risk at these price levels, suggests that Bitcoin is preparing for a significant upward move. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 Source: IntoTheCryptoverse Traders are anticipating this potential breakout, which could mark the beginning of a new bullish cycle. Bitcoin’s current price level holds the potential for a rally. With historical data, technical indicators, and social sentiment all pointing toward a rise, BTC appears poised to break higher. Investors may find this an opportune time to monitor the market for a possible upward move.    Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin Holds Over $60,000; Ethereum Struggle 
Date: 11 Oct 2024, 5:55 am
Content:
Crypto Price Today: The crypto market is experiencing a mix of fluctuations today. Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) prices show varying trends. While Ethereum sees minor corrections, Bitcoin is gradually recovering after recent losses. The current state of the market reflects overall uncertainty, with investors closely monitoring key support and resistance levels. Bitcoin is currently priced at $60,672.01, with a slight gain of 0.10% over the last 24 hours. The BTC chart shows signs of a recovery after a recent dip. It experienced strong support at the $60,222 level and is now approaching its next resistance at $60,904. Resistance Levels: $60,904 and $61,321. Support Levels: $60,222 and $59,541. The Bollinger Bands indicate moderate volatility, with BTC attempting to break above the upper band. A successful breakout above $60,904 could push the price towards $61,321. However, failure to sustain above $60,672 may lead to a retest of $60,222. The trading volume on Binance is relatively low, at 141 BTC. This low trading volume reflects cautious sentiment in the market. Traders are likely waiting for a clear trend before entering positions. Ethereum is trading at $2,405.72, down by 0.14% in the last 24 hours. The chart indicates a slight downward movement, with ETH showing resistance at the $2,420 level. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, suggesting a potential increase in price volatility.  Key levels to watch: Resistance Levels: $2,420 and $2,448. Support Levels: $2,389 and $2,358. The price movement indicates consolidation around the $2,400 mark. The narrowing of the Bollinger Bands suggests a possible breakout soon. If Ethereum manages to break above the $2,420 resistance, it could see further gains. However, if it falls below $2,389, it may test the lower support at $2,358. Volume analysis shows low trading activity, with a volume of 1.27K on Binance. This low volume may indicate indecision among traders. For Ethereum, monitoring the price behavior around the support and resistance levels is crucial. Any significant increase in trading volume could trigger larger price movements. United States prosecutors have recommended an 18-month jail sentence for Heather Morgan. Morgan, also known as “Razzlekhan,” was involved in laundering 120,000 Bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex in 2016. The recommendation comes after Morgan provided substantial assistance in her and her husband’s plea bargain in July 2023. Morgan admitted to laundering the Bitcoin, currently worth $7.2 billion. The stolen funds were laundered using non-compliant crypto exchanges, darknet markets, and mixers. Morgan and her husband, Ilya Lichtenshtein, used sophisticated techniques to conceal their tracks. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking a lighter sentence for Morgan due to her cooperation. Prosecutors noted that Morgan was a lower-level participant compared to Lichtenshtein. She had only spent a small fraction of the stolen funds and was unaware of Lichtenshtein’s involvement in the hack until 2020. Lichtenshtein pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and faces up to 20 years in prison. Morgan’s sentencing is scheduled for November 15, while Lichtenshtein’s is set for November 14. Fidelity Investments confirmed a data breach affecting more than 77,000 customers. The breach occurred between August 17 and August 19, 2024. Unauthorized access to customer information was gained through two newly created accounts. Sensitive data, including Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, was exposed. Fidelity engaged external security experts to investigate the breach. The firm offered affected customers credit monitoring and identity restoration services. The breach occurred following a ransomware attack at Infosys McCamish Systems, an IT partner for Fidelity. Although the two incidents are unrelated, they raise concerns about the security of customer data. 1. Polkadot (DOT): $4.09, +0.67% (24h) 2. Solana (SOL): $140.89, +0.82% (24h) 3.

Ethereum and Bitcoin are showing resilience despite low trading volumes. The upcoming legal developments for Heather Morgan and Ilya Lichtenshtein may influence market sentiment. Investors will also be keeping a close eye on Fidelity’s actions following the data breach. The crypto market may see increased volatility in the coming days. Traders should watch key support and resistance levels for major cryptocurrencies. Any significant news or developments could trigger large price movements. Follow Us © Analytics Insight 2024

Title: Warning from the analyst: Watch out for Bitcoin (BTC) in the | Crypto De Nostradame on Binance Square

Warning from the analyst: Watch out for Bitcoin (BTC) in the short term! According to Onchain data, short-term investors have started to play a more important role in the course of Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin investors can be classified as short-term holders (STH) and long-term holders (LTH). Long-term holders are associated with BTC addresses that have held Bitcoin for 155 days or more, while short-term holders are those who have held it for less than the time period specified above. Bitcoin's recent price movements seem to be more dependent on short-term investors. CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci stated that STHs could panic sell if BTC falls below $ 61,600. The analyst stated that the current average cost of short-term Bitcoin holders for 1-3 months and 3-6 months is $ 61,633 and $ 64,459, respectively. As seen in the chart, the price is currently stuck between this certain range and is waiting for a breakout. Kesmeci stated that if $64,500 is exceeded, the bulls may take over. He also said: “If the average cost of 1-3 month $BTC  investors is lost at 61.6 thousand, things will become even more difficult.” A drop below $61,600 could lead to panic selling by short-term investors at a loss. Data from CryptoQuant shows that STHs are almost completely unprofitable. The STH Net Unrealized Profit/Loss Cohort (STH-NUPL) chart is just above 0, which means that most short-term holders are currently unprofitable.#KIP #KIPprotocol #ReeCoin #Reeder

CryptoQuant CEO Explains the Right Choice for Bitcoin (BTC) and Altcoins, Warns of a Decline! "Trump or Harris?"  Ki Young Ju argued that Trump is the right choice for the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.  There is very little time left for the US Presidential elections, one of the most important events closely followed by Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency investors.  The importance of BTC and cryptocurrencies stems from the candidates' approaches. While former President Donald Trump openly supports BTC and crypto, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris has not made any statements about cryptocurrencies until recently. This has largely led cryptocurrency voters to Trump.  At this point, analysts stated that Trump's victory is a great chance for Bitcoin and altcoins, while the final assessment came from CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju.  The Right Choice for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies: Donald Trump!  Sharing from the X account, Ki Young Ju argued that Trump is the right choice for the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.  Starting by stating that he is not an expert on American politics, Ki Young Ju said that as someone in the cryptocurrency industry, he can easily say who has more shares in the election game.  At this point, the famous CEO addressed cryptocurrency supporters and said that Trump was the right choice for BTC and crypto.  "If you support the future of cryptocurrencies, Donald Trump is the right choice.  He is a businessman. His interest in making money from crypto shows that he takes crypto seriously. He even launched his own coin.  His statements and promises at the Bitcoin Conference appear to reflect both personal and national interests."  The famous CEO also noted that a Trump presidency could lead to meaningful and positive discussions on crypto regulation, creating rules for Web3 growth, and addressing issues in unregulated markets.  In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris has shown little interest in cryptocurrencies, according to Ju, raising concerns about potential market declines without proper regulation.

Main reasons of BTC sharp fall...🤷 Bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline due to several factors contributing to market pressure. A significant reason is institutional sell-offs, as large investors seem to be reducing their positions. This could be linked to rising U.S. Treasury bond yields, which often signal lower liquidity in the market and push riskier assets like Bitcoin downward. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding potential interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve has created a negative sentiment across global markets, further influencing Bitcoin's drop.  Another contributing factor is the liquidation of large long positions in Bitcoin futures. Over $400 million worth of long positions were liquidated in a short period, causing a cascading effect in the market as prices dropped further.  Finally, there is speculation that a large player may have offloaded their Bitcoin holdings to move into other assets, such as Ethereum, following rumors of an Ethereum Futures ETF approval.  These factors, combined, have led to the recent sharp decline in Bitcoin's price. .$BTC $UNI $ETH  #moonbix #SCRLaunchpoolStarts! #BTC60KResistance #USRateCutExpected #Write2Earn!

With a 13,000% golden cross pattern emerging, ETFSwap (ETFS) is already making waves in the crypto ETF space, attracting the attention of whales who are confident that this altcoin could skyrocket after its ICO. Currently in its final ICO stage, ETFSwap (ETFS) is priced at just $0.03846—a rock-bottom price for an altcoin that experts believe could follow Bitcoin’s (BTC) path to massive gains. The analyst who called Bitcoin’s (BTC) 2021 peak believes that ETFSwap (ETFS) has the potential to achieve similar success, making this ICO one of the hottest opportunities in the market today. The confidence in ETFSwap (ETFS) stems from its groundbreaking utilities and robust infrastructure. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this project is designed to disrupt the crypto ETF ecosystem with its advanced DeFi offerings, superior security, and a trailblazing approach to tokenized assets. ETFSwap (ETFS) has already passed rigorous audits by Cyberscope and its team KYC-verified by SolidProof, confirming the project’s safety and solid KYC compliance. Crypto investors, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) whales, are flocking to the ETFSwap (ETFS) ICO, knowing that this could be their next big win. With a highly anticipated launch and massive potential for growth as the golden cross patterns show, many believe ETFSwap (ETFS) could rise to rival the greats in the crypto world.  ETFSwap (ETFS) is already making its mark with advanced DeFi innovations. The project offers users the ability to stake tokens for rewards, access liquidity pools, track ETF prices in real-time, and trade popular ETFs. The team behind ETFSwap (ETFS) has spent over 15 weeks refining the platform’s ETF trading tools, including the ETF tracker and ETF screener, all designed to provide users with a cutting-edge experience. With all backend development complete, ETFSwap (ETFS) is set to launch soon, and early investors stand to benefit the most. The crypto world has seen the significance of the golden cross pattern time and again, and ETFSwap (ETFS) is now displaying the same pattern that Bitcoin (BTC) exhibited before its massive rise in 2021. A golden cross occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, signaling a potential surge in price. For Bitcoin (BTC), this pattern led to its historic peak, and now, the same setup is appearing with ETFSwap (ETFS), leading many to believe that this altcoin could deliver unprecedented gains. The Analyst sees the golden cross as a clear signal that ETFSwap (ETFS) belongs in the same league as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The same market forces that propelled Bitcoin (BTC) from a few dollars to over $60,000 are now lining up for ETFSwap (ETFS). Early investors in Bitcoin (BTC) saw life-changing gains, and those who invest in ETFSwap (ETFS) during this final ICO stage could experience a similar fortune. The parallels between Bitcoin’s (BTC) 2021 peak and the golden cross pattern forming for ETFSwap (ETFS) are impossible to ignore. With its current ICO price of $0.03846, ETFSwap (ETFS) offers investors a rare opportunity to get in at the ground level of a potentially explosive altcoin. As history has shown with Bitcoin (BTC), early investment is key to reaping the rewards of massive growth. ETFSwap (ETFS) could be the next big thing in crypto ETFs, and the time to act is now.

Title: Bitcoin Whale Panic-Sells 800 $BTC, Loses $26 Million Since June
Date: Date not available
Content:
In a dramatic development, a crypto whale reportedly panic-sold 800 $BTC at a value of $48.5M, after a recent plunge in Bitcoin’s price. As per the data from Lookonchain, a prominent on-chain analytics provider, the respective whale’s movement has been going through scrutiny since the 19th of June when it started accumulating Bitcoin in huge numbers. The analytics provider offered the details of this development on its official X account. This whale panic-sold 800 $BTC($48.5M) again after the $BTC price dropped!Since June 19, this whale has accumulated 11,659 $BTC($727M) at $62,362, and sold 10,345 $BTC($619M) at $59,847, losing ~$26M, and still holds 8,936 $BTC($540M).Address:… pic.twitter.com/5pUzgvSGCr Lookonchain mentioned that the respective whale’s offloading of 800 Bitcoin driven by a market dip serves as a chief instance of the crypto volatility and the resultant emotional reactions. Since the beginning of $BTC accumulation by this whale, it has reportedly gathered 11,659 tokens in total. This figure reportedly accounts for $727M with $62,362 as the average price per $BTC. Nonetheless, the investor later offloaded 10,345 $BTC, equaling $619M, at an average token price of nearly $59,847. This led to a staggering loss of almost $26M during the last few months. However, irrespective of these substantial sales, the above-mentioned whale currently holds up to 8,936 $BTC. This amount is approximately valued at $540M in line with the present market prices. Selling during a dip normally signifies fear-driven decisions instead of long-term strategies. Hence, it can create a ripple effect influencing the market to further amplify the price fluctuations. With the infamous price swings of Bitcoin, such whales can significantly affect the overall market sentiment. Thus, this can result in selling or buying pressure.

Title: 5 High-Performing Altcoins Set to Outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in Q4 2024 - Times Tabloid
Date: October 11, 2024
Content:
As the cryptocurrency market reaches the closing month of 2024, attention has shifted to what other potential high-yield altcoins would begin to dominate over Bitcoin because of the market value. Despite that, it goes without saying that Bitcoin will always sit at the helm within all the chaos brought about by other shifts of cryptocurrencies at that time – and their geographically derived dominance. Its sheer weight, however, usually restricts the degree to which volatility of price can swing the graph into deep profit margins or loss margins. In fact, the only most important factor in the disparity in average return of the rest of the capital invested in them as compared to BTC is the smaller market constituency and lesser degree of diffusion of the applications. In this article, we are going to analyze five enthusiastic altcoins that are expected to outgrow Bitcoin in the last quarter of the year 2024, all led by Rexas Finance (RXS).  Rexas Finance (RXS) is number one as a robust program in relation to the ideation concerns – as far as real-world assets such as real estate, land, commodities, art, etc. conversion into virtual tokens are concerned. With the help of Rexas Finance, it is possible to break the barrier of investing in such assets by sharing these assets and polishing ownership through enabled blockchain systems. New structures in the zealous and resistant world are emerging due to the irrepressible tokenization of Rexas Finance. Launchpad: The Launchpad comes as one of the most useful features in Rexas Finance as it helps new projects and start-ups find funds by selling tokens to initial investors. It helps business people bring their creative ideas to actual business in the least time possible. As the appetite for selling tokens increases, it is predicted that the Rexas Finance Launchpad will be of great importance in the crypto marketplace. Ongoing Giveaway: To the pleasure of the developing community and its followers of Rexas Finance, Rexas Finance is giving away $50,000 each to 20 participants in an interesting giveaway. The giveaway was designed to increase the user base and thank people who wish to be among the early adopters of the platform. Only those who are okay with sharing ERC-20 wallet addresses and completing some missions that enhance the chances of winning the giveaway will get to take part in the giveaway. The token is largely used for participating in the giveaway and so there is a lot of interest in the ecosystem of Rexas Finance. Real-World Use Cases: There is also a lot of practicality attached to the capability of converting real-world assets into a digitized form. Thus, by enabling the tokenization of real estate or the fractionalization of high-value assets such as gold or artworks, Rexas Finance is tapping into markets running into trillions of dollars. The fusion of traditional finance and blockchain technology validates the position of Rexas Finance within the right time and space to lead the tokenization industry.  With the current price of $0.06 and with the positive trend of its presale stages where people are buying its tokens, Rexas Finance is gaining some traction. There was a good performance in Stages 1 – 3 of the presale where millions of dollars were raised, and phase 4 is still ongoing selling tokens at $0.06. Taking into account its uniqueness in the asset tokenization niche and the talk around its giveaway, the price of Rexas Finance is likely to go up dramatically in the 4th quarter. However, many users are looking forward to RXS reaching more all-time high values than the foretasted performance of Bitcoin PCs during the same period. Every single person using the term Chainlink (LINK) has some spatial perception of intelligent machines or projects worth their money in the future. Such perception is allowed because, without the use of macro economy services used in the base of Chainlink, they will not be functional. Chainlink also collaborates with other systems to ensure that there is a connectivity framework that ensures all application domains built on the blockchain work efficiently. 2024 is the year when Chainlink has diversified revenue sources by reaching out to bigger segments of the blockchains and bringing in more funds. In particular, due to the expansion of de Bankless lending and de Fi industry base, such adoption of these decentralized oracles is expected to increase which is bullish for the future performance of LINK. In particular, if such momentum is sustained further LINK price could appreciate by 2024 due to new partnerships and the development of real-life use cases. Another altcoin that has some untapped potential, particularly in the supply chain management domain is VeChain (VET). Due to VeChain’s application of blockchain technology where various parties involved can trace and evaluate the distribution of products, the distribution process, particularly finished goods, is more efficient and safe. This is crucial in markets such as luxury goods, medicines, and food – all of which have a need for such products to be shielded from sabotage. With these key players i.e. BMW and other global corporates, VeChain has established itself as a leader in the provision of solutions to the existing problems of the supply chain through the use of blockchain technology. An increase in the number of enterprises operating with VETs owing to a need for operational clarity is bound to cause an increase in the supply and thus demand for VETs. Towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, VeChain will experience a significant price surge that will surpass that which Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have recorded. Aave (AAVE) is undoubtedly among the popular players in the lending and borrowing business that is booming. By enabling its clients to extend loans and also provide a number of digital currencies, Aave has bridged that gap in finance of the unbanked segment. Of all these features, the flash loan system and other features like of liquidity pools have made the system more popular among the users of DeFi. As DeFi is a continuous innovation, the potential of Aave in terms of customer growth and liquidity on its platform holds great promise. AAVE will hit the market with high attention because now there will be more DeFi products and services available for customers therefore there will be price bursts at specific times which are most likely going to happen in Q4 2024. Aave plans to target certain geographical locations that are probably smarter than Bitcoin’s in providing decentralized financial services taking advantage of that period and in this case, the Aave token is likely to perform well. Injective Protocol, new INJ, seeks to revolutionize derivative trading and create an expansive accessible financial market that includes, but is not limited to, cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, and forex through decentralized networks/systems. As stated in this article, Binance is precisely where we shall begin the discussion on the derivative platforms where there are pretty many options for Indian users. Very many of them include Kraken, BitMEX, and most recently, a mediated one, which is the satanic-narrative-administered Binance smart chain itself. One well-known pattern with the majority of such intermediation structures is that they usually provide two advantages. Beta Ethereum L2 and some affording networks aim to establish dapp network economies. New demand started to rise thanks to fresh investors bringing in new decentralized cryptocurrencies to support the rally which was evident by the inflow of retail traders. Applications designed around this paradigm seek to provide the same set of features to the end user as centralized finance applications do but without the aforementioned disadvantages that afflict centralized financing. There is a large probability that such a unique offer along with an increasing population base will allow Injective Protocol to retain the course rate booster in Q4 of 2024 surpassing any other currency, a rather unfortunate word to use as it encompasses more than just a digital name and even Bitcoin. The interest in Bitcoin continues to grow, yet participants in the market surmise that projects such as Rexas Finance (RXS), Chainlink (LINK), VeChain (VET), Aave AAVE) and Injective Protocol (INJ) will provide better returns in Q4 2024. Here, in particular, Rexas Finance is first to the party over the ability of real assets tokenization and interacting with the community through Launchpad and active giveaway campaigns. Seeing that these competing coins are slowly developing and, as such, are carving their niches, they are also likely to yield greater returns than what Bitcoin can offer. Therefore, investments in them are one investment cycle worth taking notice of in Q4 2024.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Now Control Over 925,000 BTC as Institutional Demand Soars
Date: Date not available
Content:
The Currency analytics 
Cryptocurrency News – REAL News ® – TCAT  Bitcoin’s presence in traditional financial markets continues to grow, with Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) now controlling a substantial portion of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. According to recent data, Bitcoin ETFs currently hold 925,266 BTC, which amounts to nearly 5% of the total circulating supply. This shift represents a significant development for Bitcoin as major financial players increasingly turn to ETFs to gain exposure to the digital asset.  On-chain analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted the importance of Bitcoin ETFs, which now control approximately $59.2 billion worth of BTC. The surge in ETF holdings marks a pivotal moment for Bitcoin, as it reflects the growing interest from institutional investors who view the cryptocurrency as a key asset in their portfolios. The biggest names in finance, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, are leading this charge. Both companies have been instrumental in driving the demand for Bitcoin through their respective ETFs. Institutional players are now responsible for a substantial share of Bitcoin’s supply, indicating a major shift in the way the asset is perceived in traditional financial circles. Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant inflows in recent weeks, driven by increased institutional demand. A combined $235 million in fresh capital has flowed into these funds, with Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF leading the way, attracting $103.7 million. BlackRock’s ETF closely followed, pulling in $97.9 million in new investments. This influx of capital highlights the growing acceptance of Bitcoin among traditional financial institutions. ETFs provide a familiar and regulated avenue for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without needing to deal with the complexities of managing private keys or navigating volatile cryptocurrency exchanges. Fidelity and BlackRock may be the dominant players, but other funds like Ark Invest and Bitwise have also contributed to this growth. Ark Invest brought in $12.6 million, while Bitwise added $13 million, further underscoring the broadening appeal of Bitcoin ETFs. The rise of Bitcoin ETFs has helped bridge the gap between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency sector. By offering a secure, regulated way to invest in Bitcoin, ETFs have made it easier for institutional investors to enter the crypto market. This influx of institutional capital is expected to have long-term implications for Bitcoin’s price and market dynamics. As Bitcoin ETFs gain popularity, they are absorbing significant amounts of Bitcoin from the market. With 925,266 BTC now held in these funds, institutional investors have taken on a prominent role in shaping the future of the asset. The continued growth of Bitcoin ETFs signals increasing confidence in the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency. With Bitcoin ETFs controlling such a large portion of the asset’s circulating supply, the long-term outlook for BTC appears promising. Despite short-term price fluctuations, the growing involvement of major financial institutions is a positive indicator for Bitcoin’s future. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $62,276.20, slightly down by 0.57%. However, the larger trend suggests that the asset’s long-term trajectory remains upward, fueled by institutional interest and ongoing ETF inflows. Major corporations like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also increasing their involvement in Bitcoin ETFs, further solidifying the asset’s place in institutional portfolios. This growing demand from large-scale investors indicates that Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly important asset in the global financial ecosystem. The rapid accumulation of Bitcoin by ETFs suggests that institutional investors are betting heavily on the future of the digital asset. With companies like BlackRock now owning the largest share of Bitcoin in the ETF market, it’s clear that institutional acceptance of BTC is on the rise. ETFs offer an attractive option for investors who want to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the challenges associated with direct ownership. As more institutional capital flows into Bitcoin through ETFs, the market is likely to see continued growth and stability in the long term. The rise of Bitcoin ETFs and their control of over 925,000 BTC is a clear sign that institutional demand for Bitcoin is only growing. With major financial players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley leading the way, Bitcoin’s place in the traditional financial system is becoming increasingly secure. As ETFs continue to absorb large amounts of Bitcoin, the future looks bright for the cryptocurrency. Despite short-term price fluctuations, the long-term outlook remains positive, with institutional investors betting on Bitcoin’s continued growth and influence in global markets.

Title: Millennials pick crypto over other assets as $84tn wealth transfer looms – DL News
Date: Date not available
Content:
About us Copy link Millennial investors are betting their money on crypto, according to a new survey by investment bank Charles Schwab. The study examined the investment behaviour of 2,200 investors to better understand how they were approaching different kinds of exchange-traded products. When asked where they would invest their money next year, 62% of millennials surveyed said they would invest in cryptocurrencies. American stocks and fixed-income assets were second and third, respectively. The great $84 trillion wealth transfer from older generations to younger ones is expected to be a massive boon for crypto. Using data collected by Bank of America, Noelle Acheson, a crypto analyst, said that roughly $20 trillion will be invested in cryptocurrencies over the next decade. Bitcoin will see half of that money, with the rest flowing into DeFi, memecoins and other projects. Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers are paying close attention, too. Though Larry Fink, CEO of the $11.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock, called Bitcoin a tool for money laundering in 2017, his firm launched a Bitcoin ETF in January. The ETF is now the market leader, with $22 billion in investment. Fink has said that “Bitcoin” is one of the most searched-for terms on BlackRock’s site. If the Wall Street giant tracks clicks, it should also be aware of how younger generations are more interested in crypto. Fidelity, which has over $10 billion invested in its Bitcoin ETF, has actively promoted blockchain education to younger generations on TikTok and X. The 69-year-old asset manager VanEck currently has a PudgyPenguin NFT as its profile picture on X. Cryptocurrencies may have captured the hearts and wallets of millennial investors, but they do still play a role for older generations, according to Schwab’s study. After American stocks, almost half of all investors surveyed — including Gen Xers and Boomers — plan to invest in crypto ETFs over the next year. “Pretty stunning,” said Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg.

Title: Charles Schwab: Crypto ETFs Leap in Popularity To Outpace Traditional Investment Options
Date: Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 12:44 AM
Content:
Cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have gained the status of one of the top investment choices to be pursued, second only to equities, per a recent Charles Schwab survey. The research shows that 45% of the pool of ETF investors plan to invest in cryptocurrency products, thus beating fixed-income securities. This increase in crypto ETF interest is especially high among millennial investors, in which digital assets have indeed surpassed equities as the most desired investment vehicle. As many as 62% of the millennial ETF investors showed their intention to include cryptocurrency in their portfolio. The popularity of crypto ETFs isn't theoretical—their relative popularity is reflected in real market performance. Among the roughly 400 new ETFs to launch in 2024, cryptocurrency products have dominated the success stories. Results of that survey are "pretty stunning," said Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, underlining how unexpected it is for crypto to be favored over bonds, international equity, and alternatives. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, IBIT, leads the pack this year, gathering nearly $21 billion in inflows through August. Next in line is Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, FBTC, with nearly $10 billion in net inflows, while the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, ARKB, and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust, BITB, have each drawn in about $2 billion. With such obvious market appetite, some established players have kept themselves on the sidelines. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, said it was ironic that "Schwab has this data & still hasn't launched spot crypto ETFs," and maybe that could be a different outcome for those traditional investment houses.

Title: Fitness coach takes IRS to court again in battle for crypto staking reward tax precedent
Date: Date not available
Content:
This David vs Goliath story now features crypto advocacy group Coin Center in the legal battle over IRS tax policy on staking rewards. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Fitness coach and part-time crypto investor Josh Jarrett has filed a lawsuit against the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over its tax policy on staking rewards. In an Oct. 10 post on X, Jarrett shared that his 2021 attempt to clarify the issue was inconclusive as the IRS offered him a refund without addressing whether their tax stance on staking rewards was correct. While Jarrett declined the refund then, he stated that he was suing the federal agency again due to his 2020 staking rewards. The new legal battle seeks clarity on how the IRS treats staking rewards and aims to prevent similar issues from arising in the future. His latest attempt is supported by the Washington, D.C.-based crypto advocacy group Coin Center. According to the Oct. 10 court filing, Jarrett argues that taxing staking rewards as income upon creation leads to unnecessary complexity and over-taxation for individuals involved in staking. Crypto staking allows token holders to act as validators in a Proof of Stake (PoS) network. By locking tokens in a staking contract, participants earn digital assets for supporting the blockchain. Jarrett contends that tokens generated through staking should be treated as property and taxed only when sold. He stated: “Staking rewards are new property—not income. Just like the IRS doesn’t tax farmers when crops grow or miners when they find gold or silver, they shouldn’t tax tokens when they’re created. The law is clear: tax should only be applied when they are sold.” The crypto advocacy group Coin Center supports this view. The organization argued that the IRS’s stance results in over-taxation, compliance challenges, and stifles innovation. According to the firm, block rewards, earned when validators add new blocks to a blockchain, are new cryptocurrency tokens. So, the IRS’s current policy unlawfully taxes these tokens as income when created. However, since block rewards represent new property, tax should only apply when they are sold. Coin Center emphasized that federal tax laws and agencies’ interpretations of these laws can significantly discourage using digital assets and permissionless technologies in the US.

Title: FBI's Crypto Sting Leads to Fraud Indictments

New Articles Professor Ann Lipton recently wrote about an ingenious scheme developed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that has resulted in indictments of 18 individuals and entities for alleged fraud and manipulation in the crypto currency markets. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which also filed civil complaints, the FBI directed the creation of a crypto asset, named NexfundAI, along with related promotional materials on a publicly available website. The FBI did so as part of an undercover investigation into crypto asset market manipulation. The FBI wanted to clearly establish that the crypto asset was a security under the "investment contract" definition created by the U.S. Supreme Court in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946).  Importantly, the SEC alleges that NexfundAI was offered and sold to the public on a crypto trading platform. For me, this raises some interesting questions.  The SEC clearly believes, and has alleged in filings in federal court, that NexfundAI is a security. I did not find evidence of an effective registration statement for NexfundAI on EDGAR. The government might take the position that NexfundAI is exempt under Section 3(a)(2). However, it does not appear that NexfundAI is a security issued or guaranteed by the United States. Section 3(a)(2) also exempts securities issued by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the Government of the United States pursuant to authority granted by the Congress of the United States). Was the FBI acting pursuant to authority granted by the U.S. Congress? Another question is what about the public who invested in NexfundAI? The FBI is asking persons who bought or sold to complete this form, but does not commit to providing any restitution. Finally, one wonders whether the active participation of the FBI in creating NexfundAI will provide those charged with a defense. This is a question that I raised over a decade ago in another securities law prosecution in which the FBI was an active participant.  More Upcoming Events   Sign Up for e-NewsBulletins   You are responsible for reading, understanding, and agreeing to the National Law Review's (NLR’s) and the National Law Forum LLC's  Terms of Use and Privacy Policy before using the National Law Review website.

Title: The Readout: Denali x Sanofi, Genentech, crypto for CRISPR news
Date: Date not available

 Don't miss out Subscribe to STAT+ today, for the best life sciences journalism in the industry By Meghana Keshavan Oct. 11, 2024 This story first appeared in The Readout newsletter. Sign up for The Readout and receive STAT’s award-winning biotech news delivered straight to your inbox.  This newsletter was penned in the company of some mastodon fossils in New York. They say good morning, too. advertisement Today, we see an escalating battle between Eli Lilly and compounding pharmacies putting patients in the crossfire. Also, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is urging the FTC to probe the impending Catalent acquisition by Novo Holdings, and more. The battle is intensifying between Eli Lilly, whose weight loss and diabetes drugs are flying off shelves, and the compounding pharmacies that are producing off-brand versions of these medicines. The FDA last week declared an end to the shortage of Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound, and warned compounders to stop making copycat versions. But, as STAT’s Elaine Chen reports, many patients can’t afford the branded drugs, which carry a list price of more than $1,000 a month, and pharmacies are still having trouble keeping them in stock. advertisement “A lot of people don’t understand how temporary those compounding allowances are,” one researcher tracking drug shortages told STAT. “It seems like people really started to rely on those products that were never — they were always kind of doomed.” Read more. An advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration yesterday recommended the approval of a drug from Stealth Biotherapeutics to treat patients with Barth Syndrome, an ultra-rare and fatal mitochondrial disease. By a 10-6 vote, members of the FDA’s Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee concluded the Stealth drug, called elamipretide, was an effective treatment for Barth Syndrome, which causes muscle and cardiac weakness, fatigue, and delayed growth. The disease affects about 130 boys in the U.S. During the meeting, FDA reviewers raised concerns that elamipretide’s clinical data were not sufficient to support approval. A randomized, placebo-controlled study that administered the drug to just 12 patients failed to achieve its efficacy goals. Stealth argued the drug was safe and that patients taking the drug in a long-term extension stage reported benefits. The panel members also heard testimony from Barth patients, caregivers, and physicians who said the drug should be approved. The FDA is expected to make a decision on elamipretide by Jan. 29. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is urging the FTC to “closely scrutinize” the $16.5 billion acquisition of contract drug manufacturer Catalent by Novo Nordisk’s parent foundation. She argued that buying the company, which fills and packages syringes and injection pens for Novo Nordisk and other drugmakers — including its rival, Eli Lilly — would ultimately offer the company an unfair advantage. “I am concerned that Novo Nordisk’s merger with Catalent will give Novo Nordisk unprecedented visibility into and control over its competitor’s production capacity, costs, and business practices, and the ability to preference its own products and obstruct its competitors’ use of catalent to produce” the drugs, she wrote. Read more here, and for background on the issue read this. How does John Maraganore decide which startups to get involved in? Why are longevity-minded tech bros getting involved with a controversial CRISPR scientist? And who would you rather hang out with at the STAT Summit next week, Adam or Allison? We discuss all that and more on this week’s episode of “The Readout LOUD,” STAT’s biotech podcast. First, biotech veteran John Maraganore calls in to discuss his new startup, City Therapeutics, this week’s Nobel Prize awards, and the nerdy accolade he just received. Adam and Allison also talk to STAT’s Megan Molteni about her new article on “CRISPR baby” scientist He Jiankui and his new cryptocurrency financier. Listen here. And if you’re interested in a transcript of the conversation with Maraganore, here you go. From STAT’s Jason Mast: Six years ago, Sanofi gave $125 million and promised over $1 billion in milestone payments to buzzy neuroscience startup Denali Therapeutics to go after a promising new target called RIPK1. The enzyme is thought to play a key role in cell death and the immune system — it operates on the same pathway as TNF, the target of an obscure drug called Humira — and the companies planned to study drugs in ALS, Alzheimer’s, and at least a couple immune-related diseases. That partnership has not gone well. Although Denali is now a $3.7 billion public company, fueled by a technology it developed for shepherding proteins into the brain, the RIPK1 pact has mostly turned up duds. In 2020, the partners switched one of their lead drugs to a backup after initial studies. This past April, Sanofi announced the drug failed to slow ALS in a Phase 2 trial. And yesterday, Denali announced that Sanofi informed it that drug failed in multiple sclerosis as well. At least one trial is still ongoing on a second drug that Sanofi is studying in ulcerative colitis. But the French drugmaker already scrapped a trial of that therapy in lupus. A couple other companies still appear to have interest. Eli Lilly has a partnership with Rigel Pharmaceuticals on RIPK1, although that was signed in 2021, before the series of setbacks. Nearly 60% of the experts reviewing manuscripts for four major journals — The BMJ, JAMA, The Lancet, and The New England Journal of Medicine — received substantial payments from industry during a recent three-year period, according to a new study. This new analysis highlights how fraught the world of peer review can be with conflict of interest. BMJ executive editor Theodora Bloom told STAT that the journal “does, indeed, believe both scrutiny and transparency are necessary” and that authors, reviewers, and editors declare their interests. Other journal editors said similar. Read more.

Title: Crypto CEO on the run after allegedly stealing 1,800 BTC and 28,000 ETH
Date: 
2:32 PM • Oct 11, 2024 
Content:
A crypto CEO accused of stealing bitcoin and ether currently worth more than $170 million has gone on the run after tampering with his ankle tag, prosecutors announced on Thursday. According to an October 10 filing in New York, sixty-four-year-old Horst Jicha “tampered with his ankle bracelet on Friday, October 4, 2024, and has absconded in violation of his pretrial conditions.” Pretrial services reportedly alerted the government 12 hours after the bracelet stopped working and an arrest warrant was requested that evening. Read more: Binance exec accused of tax evasion flees Nigeria during mosque visit German citizen Jicha ran USI-Tech, an alleged multi-level marketing scheme that claimed to be a crypto-mining investment firm. From December 2017, USI-Tech received various cease and desist letters from US and Canadian securities authorities before shutting down in January 2018.   After this Jicha halted withdrawals and blamed investors for the shutdown, accusing them of misrepresenting the firm. He then allegedly ignored investor complaints and between 2017 and 2018, moved USI’s crypto holdings (worth ~$94 million at the time of the indictment) to a crypto account under his name.  Jicha, who had lived outside the US for five years, was arrested during a 2023 vacation in Miami. At this point, the missing 1,774 bitcoins and 28,589 ether were worth $150 million and he was charged with money laundering, wire fraud conspiracy, and securities fraud.  Jicha was released on bail with a $5 million bond and subsequently moved to New York where he remained under house arrest. According to the New York Daily News, his lawyer last contacted him on September 28. Got a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

Title: As Trump and Harris Battle On, the Crypto Industry Tries to Swing the Election - Brave New Coin
Date: Date not available
Content:
The stakes are high for crypto in the election cycle, though opinions are divided as to whether either party will embrace the industry Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s odds of winning the 2024 U.S. presidential election have surged, hitting a two-month high, according to leading prediction market Polymarket. As of the latest figures, Trump holds a 55.8% chance of victory, while Vice President Kamala Harris trails with 43.8%. These percentages reflect the sentiments of traders who have collectively wagered over $1.6 billion on the outcome of the November election.   Source: Polymarket Trump’s rise in the odds follows the announcement by President Joe Biden that he would not seek reelection, leaving Harris as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Other prediction platforms, such as Kalshi and PredictIt, also show Trump leading. Kalshi, which recently gained permission to list U.S. election contracts, puts Trump at 52% compared to Harris’ 48%, while PredictIt shows a slimmer margin, with Trump at 53% and Harris at 52%. The surge in Trump’s odds comes at a time when the cryptocurrency industry is keenly watching the election. Trump has promised to turn the U.S. into the “crypto capital of the world,” and some experts believe that regardless of who wins, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are poised for significant growth. According to Dan Tapiero, founder of 10T Holdings, the price of Bitcoin is expected to hit $100,000 soon, irrespective of the election results. Speaking at the Permissionless conference in Salt Lake City, Utah, Tapiero remarked, “I don’t think it really matters. Everything is going up now. The election will pass.” Tapiero believes Bitcoin is a proxy for the broader cryptocurrency market and expects other digital assets to follow Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. Similarly, CK Zheng, Chief Investment Officer of ZX Squared Capital, also expressed optimism, saying that the upcoming election would benefit Bitcoin regardless of the winner. Zheng highlighted the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in April, which historically leads to strong fourth quarters, as a major driver of price increases. He added that neither Trump nor Harris has addressed rising U.S. debts and deficits, an issue that could play in Bitcoin’s favor post-election. “This will be very bullish for Bitcoin, especially post the U.S. election,” Zheng noted. Trump’s pro-crypto stance has captured the attention of many in the industry. He has vowed to fire SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who has led aggressive enforcement actions against cryptocurrency companies. Gensler’s policies have been seen as stifling innovation, and Trump’s promise to remove him has been met with applause by many crypto enthusiasts. However, Kamala Harris is not entirely silent on the issue. In recent weeks, she has included blockchain technology as one of several emerging technologies where she believes the U.S. should remain dominant. This shift has been seen as a response to the growing importance of crypto and digital assets in global markets. Interestingly, SEC enforcement head Gurbir Grewal stepped down in early October, potentially signaling a pivot in the current administration’s approach to crypto regulation. Despite Trump’s vocal support for cryptocurrencies, some in the crypto community remain divided. His controversial launch of a Trump-affiliated crypto project in September led some industry supporters to criticize him, stating that he had “lost their votes.”  Source: X Nonetheless, crypto markets remain optimistic about the future. Financial experts, including Alex Kruger, founder of Asgard, believe that broader economic forces, such as rate cuts and increased liquidity, will drive asset prices higher, with Bitcoin standing to benefit the most. Kruger predicts that once uncertainty around the election clears, money will flow into riskier assets like crypto. “Liquidity is going to be flowing into the market,” Kruger said, adding that Bitcoin and other assets could see significant gains as investors shift from short-term investments to longer-term options. Joe McCann, founder of crypto investment firm Asymmetric stated that institutional investors are ready to pour money into the markets regardless of the election outcome. “No matter who wins, the view is that the market’s going higher,” McCann said. He added that Trump’s pro-crypto stance could accelerate Bitcoin’s rise, but even a Harris victory would not slow Bitcoin’s long-term upward trajectory. Meanwhile, a recent Time article took a cautiously skeptical view of crypto’s political strategies in 2024. While the industry has poured massive amounts of money into campaigns and rallied grassroots supporters, it faces significant challenges in public perception and regulatory hurdles. The aggressive spending and polarized tactics could either lead to a breakthrough for crypto-friendly legislation or cause a political backlash that delays meaningful progress for years. Cryptocurrency players are pouring significant amounts of money into political campaigns in an effort to influence U.S. elections. This includes donations to various candidates and PACs (Political Action Committees), particularly through Coinbase’s super PAC, *Fairshake*, which has raised over $200 million. Cryptocurrency donations now make up nearly half of all corporate political contributions in 2024, a huge amount relative to the industry’s public standing. Despite this financial clout, the article notes that the crypto industry faces challenges in gaining mainstream public approval. Polls from Pew and Gallup don’t even list cryptocurrency as a top issue, and a Federal Reserve survey indicates that only 7% of Americans owned or used crypto in 2023. Furthermore, a large portion of Americans still harbor negative opinions about crypto, with 69% of voters in swing states holding unfavorable views. The industry is battling the fallout from major scandals, such as the collapse of FTX and the criminal charges against its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. The FTX collapse and Bankman-Fried’s criminal activities had profound reputational consequences for the entire crypto industry. The article highlights that while some industry insiders thought the scandal might serve as a catalyst for clear federal regulations, the opposite has happened. The SEC, under Gary Gensler, has increased its enforcement actions, suing crypto companies and trying to block initiatives like Bitcoin ETFs. This regulatory pressure has united crypto supporters in their opposition to Gensler’s approach. The article discusses the crypto industry’s top legislative goal, the *FIT21* bill, which would shift oversight of most digital assets from the SEC to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The bill passed in the House but has yet to be voted on in the Senate. The article expresses skepticism about its passage, citing political infighting and reports suggesting that the crypto industry’s aggressive lobbying tactics could backfire. A researcher from TD Cowen wrote that crypto’s attempts to sway Senate races could anger key legislators and delay any real progress until 2026. Crypto is not only pouring money into Republican candidates but also into some Democratic campaigns, making it a bipartisan effort. On the Republican side, Donald Trump has made the biggest splash, pledging to fire Gary Gensler on day one of his presidency and positioning himself as a champion of Bitcoin. His VP pick, J.D. Vance, has also embraced the crypto industry as a way to fight against what he calls “social justice mobs.” However, the article notes that while Republicans have embraced crypto, supporting one party too heavily could alienate Democrats, who hold key positions on financial regulatory matters. There is also friction within the crypto world about the right approach. Some insiders worry that focusing too much on ousting Gensler may only bring temporary relief, while a new SEC chair could still be tough on crypto. The ultimate goal, for many, is bipartisan legislation that regulates crypto fairly, regardless of who is in power.    Crypto lobbying has taken various forms. Apart from financial contributions, crypto companies are organizing rallies and mobilizing grassroots support through initiatives like Stand With Crypto, a campaign launched by Coinbase to generate public support for pro-crypto politicians. The article covers events like watch parties, where crypto enthusiasts gather, but notes that rallying grassroots support can be difficult. At one event, many participants admitted that while they supported crypto, they were less interested in politics, seeing the decentralized nature of crypto as an alternative to political systems.  Source: Stand With Crypto  Source: Stand With Crypto The article criticizes some of the tactics used by pro-crypto PACs, describing them as opaque or counterproductive. For instance, *Fairshake* spent $10 million on attack ads against California Representative Katie Porter, even though she had voiced little public opinion on crypto. The campaign tactics confused her and others, suggesting that some industry insiders might be more focused on gaining influence and funding rather than supporting true crypto champions. A key challenge is passing significant legislation on crypto. While the *FIT21* bill has had bipartisan support in the House, passing it through the Senate could prove difficult. The article notes that some Democratic politicians, like Nancy Pelosi, have quietly supported the bill, but its progress is far from guaranteed. Senate Democrats, especially figures like Sherrod Brown, may resist crypto-friendly legislation due to the industry’s controversial reputation. While crypto’s political spending is unprecedented, it’s unclear if it will ultimately pay off. The SEC remains a significant adversary, and political divisions within both the industry and U.S. parties complicate the path forward. Crypto’s influence could grow, especially if candidates like Trump fully embrace it, but there is a risk that crypto’s aggressive spending could backfire, leading to further regulatory clampdowns or legislative stagnation. As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, both the political and financial worlds are closely watching its potential impact on markets. For the cryptocurrency industry, however, experts suggest that the election’s outcome may not significantly alter the bullish outlook for assets like Bitcoin. With liquidity expected to increase and institutional money waiting on the sidelines, many believe that Bitcoin and other digital assets are set for a strong post-election surge, regardless of whether Trump or Harris takes the White House.

Title: The FBI secretly created an Ethereum token to investigate crypto fraud - The Verge
Date:  Oct 10, 2024, 5:58 PM UTC
Content:
By  Gaby Del Valle, a policy reporter. Her past work has focused on immigration politics, border surveillance technologies, and the rise of the New Right. The FBI created a cryptocurrency as part of an investigation into price manipulation in crypto markets, the government revealed on Wednesday. The FBI’s Ethereum-based token, NexFundAI, was created with the help of “cooperating witnesses.” As a result of the investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged three “market makers” and nine people for allegedly engaging in schemes to boost the prices of certain crypto assets. The Department of Justice charged 18 people and entities for “widespread fraud and manipulation” in crypto markets. The defendants allegedly made false claims about their tokens and executed so-called “wash trades” to create the impression of an active trading market, prosecutors claim. The three market makers — ZMQuant, CLS Global, and MyTrade — allegedly wash traded or conspired to wash trade on behalf of NexFundAI, an Ethereum-based token they didn’t realize was created by the FBI.  “What the FBI uncovered in this case is essentially a new twist to old-school financial crime,” Jodi Cohen, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston division, said in a statement. “What we uncovered has resulted in charges against the leadership of four cryptocurrency companies, and four crypto ‘market makers’ and their employees who are accused of spearheading a sophisticated trading scheme that allegedly bilked honest investors out of millions of dollars.” Liu Zhou, a “market maker” working with MyTrade MM, allegedly told promoters of NexFundAI that MyTrade MM was better than its competitors because they “control the pump and dump” allowing them to “do inside trading easily.” An FBI spokesperson told CoinDesk that there was limited trading activity on the coin but didn’t share additional information. On a Wednesday press call, Joshua Levy, the acting US attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said trading on the token was disabled, according to CoinDesk. The DOJ has reportedly secured $25 million from “fraudulent proceeds” that will be returned to investors.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

The idea behind these faucets is to introduce users to the world of cryptocurrencies by giving them a taste of it while also generating some traffic to the faucet’s website. One of the key aspects to consider when using crypto faucets is the potential risk of scam faucets. Scam faucets may advertise generous rewards but fail to deliver when it comes to actually providing the promised cryptocurrency. To avoid falling victim to these scams, it is important to thoroughly research the legitimacy of a faucet before using it. Reading reviews, checking forums, and consulting reputable sources can help determine the credibility and reliability of a faucet. Additionally, some scam faucets may require users to provide personal information or even send some cryptocurrency as a “registration fee.” This is a major red flag, as legitimate faucets never ask users for personal information or any kind of payment.

One example of a browser with a search engine rewards program is Brave. Brave rewards users with a cryptocurrency called Basic Attention Token (BAT) for viewing privacy-respecting ads while browsing the web. Users have the option to see ads and receive BAT tokens, which can then be used to support content creators or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies. Another example is Presearch, a decentralized search engine platform known to offer free crypto rewards with its native cryptocurrency Presearch tokens (PRE) for conducting online searches. Users earn PRE tokens by searching through the Presearch platform instead of traditional search engines like Google or Bing. To earn free crypto coins through these platforms, users generally need to create an account, enable the rewards program, and engage in desired activities such as viewing ads or conducting searches. The exact requirements and rewards vary between platforms. However, it is important for users to take precautions when participating in these reward programs to avoid scams and fraudulent schemes. It is advisable to research and choose well-established platforms with positive user reviews and transparent operations. Users should also be cautious of any requests for personal information or financial details and ensure they use secure connections and reputable platforms. Crypto rewards cards have become a popular method for people to use digital currencies in their daily routine. These cards allow users to make payments and purchases using their cryptocurrencies, bridging the gap between traditional financial transactions and the world of digital currency. One of the major advantages of these cards is the ability to earn crypto rewards, most often in the form of cashback, on everyday purchases. Users can receive a small percentage of their transaction amount back in the form of cryptocurrency, which can then be used for future purchases or simply held as an investment. This feature not only provides additional value to users but also helps to encourage the adoption and usage of cryptocurrencies. Several platforms have introduced crypto-specific credit cards to cater to the growing demand. One example is the Coinbase Card: with it, users can spend their cryptocurrencies anywhere that accepts Visa. Another option is the Gemini Mastercard; its users can earn up to 3% back in Bitcoin or other digital currencies. The Binance Card is another popular choice, providing access to a wide range of cryptocurrencies and enabling seamless spending. Additionally, Nexo offers a credit card that allows users to instantly borrow against their crypto holdings while still having the ability to earn cashback. Play-to-earn games have gained significant popularity in recent years, connecting the worlds of gaming and cryptocurrency. These games enable players to not only engage in enjoyable gameplay but also earn real-world value in the form of cryptocurrency and other digital assets. Earning cryptocurrency through gameplay typically involves players completing in-game tasks, challenges, or missions. As players progress and achieve specific milestones, P2E platforms reward users with cryptocurrency or digital assets. These rewards can then be traded or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges for other virtual currencies or even real-world money. One of the main advantages of play-to-earn games is the potential for substantial rewards. Players who invest time and effort into these games can accumulate valuable digital assets, which can appreciate in value over time.  Some popular play-to-earn games include Axie Infinity, CryptoKitties, Decentraland, and Gods Unchained. Axie Infinity, arguably the best crypto game to date, is a blockchain-based game that allows players to collect, breed, and battle creatures called Axies. Players can earn the game’s native cryptocurrency, AXS, through various in-game activities. Referral programs are commonly offered by top crypto exchanges and wallets like Binance and Coinbase as a strategy to attract new users. These programs typically work by providing existing users with a unique referral link, which they can share with their friends and acquaintances. When a new user signs up via the referral link, both the referrer and the referee receive rewards or incentives. These rewards are often in the form of commission or referral bonuses, either in cryptocurrency or fiat currency, deposited directly into the referrer’s account. The amount of the reward can vary depending on the platform and the specific terms of the referral program. For example, Binance offers a referral program where users can earn 100 USDT rebate vouchers on trading fees.  These referral programs serve multiple purposes for crypto exchanges and wallets. Firstly, they incentivize existing users to promote the platform, helping to increase its user base. Secondly, they encourage new users to sign up by providing them with an extra incentive. Finally, by rewarding users with cryptocurrency, these programs also encourage engagement and usage of the platform. Crypto savings accounts have become an increasingly popular investment option for those looking to earn passive income on their digital assets. These accounts offer higher interest rates compared to traditional banking and present an opportunity to grow the value of cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, USDC, and USDT. Additionally, since cryptocurrencies have the potential for substantial price appreciation, the value of the assets held in these savings accounts can increase even further. While a crypto saving account might be a brilliant idea in theory, its execution leaves much to be desired. Celsius and BlockFi’s dramatic downfall highlights the fragility of centralized lending platforms in the crypto space. Celsius’ unraveling, triggered by regulatory investigations and founder Alex Mashinksy’s legal troubles, exposed deep-rooted flaws in the platform’s business model. Similarly, BlockFi’s troubles, including regulatory fines and liquidity issues, cast doubt on the sustainability of centralized lending operations. These incidents underscore the need for stringent regulatory oversight and investor vigilance in the crypto lending sector, prompting a shift towards decentralized alternatives that offer greater security and transparency. Get the top 50 crypto definitions you need to know in the industry for free Unlike its centralized brother, DeFi technology allows for transparent peer-to-peer lending, cutting out middlemen and potentially offering better yields than traditional financial institutions. Nexo, Aave, and Compound stand as pillars in the crypto lending landscape, boasting years of trust and reliability. Nexo provides instant crypto-backed loans and interest-bearing accounts, offering users avenues for passive income. Aave, a DeFi protocol on Ethereum, eliminates intermediaries, enabling seamless lending and borrowing with innovative features like flash loans. Compound, another Ethereum-based DeFi platform, offers competitive rates with algorithmic interest rates and real-time interest earnings. These crypto lending platforms provide secure alternatives to earning passive income and accessing liquidity, emphasizing the importance of research and risk awareness in crypto lending endeavors. To start experimenting with lending your crypto through DeFi apps, you’ll need a compatible crypto wallet such as Coinbase Wallet. This separate product from the main Coinbase app allows users to connect with various DeFi protocols like Compound or Aave. By supplying your cryptocurrency to these lending protocols, you can receive rewards for providing liquidity to borrowers. Starting with stablecoins can be a simple way to dip your toes into decentralized finance and explore the potential for higher returns on your crypto investments. Just remember to always exercise caution and stay informed about the risks associated with DeFi lending. Make sure to only invest what you can afford to lose and do thorough research before jumping into lending through DeFi protocols. Read also: What are Reddit’s MOONs and Bricks? Reddit Moons is a unique feature on the popular social media platform that allows users to earn cryptocurrency by actively participating in the r/cryptocurrency subreddit. To start earning MOON tokens, users need to first join the r/cryptocurrency subreddit. Once a member, engagement is key to earning Reddit Moons. Crypto enthusiasts can contribute to the subreddit by participating in discussions, posting original content, sharing news, and providing valuable insight on cryptocurrencies. By adding value to the community with their contributions, users increase their chances of earning MOON tokens. Earning Reddit Moons is based on a distribution system that takes into account various factors such as the quality of contributions, upvotes received, and overall participation. The more actively a user engages with the subreddit and the more valuable their contributions are, the higher their chances of earning MOON tokens. It is important to note that Reddit Moons are not given out randomly, but rather as a reward for active participation and contribution to the r/cryptocurrency community. This creates an incentive for users to engage in meaningful discussions and provide valuable insights, ultimately benefiting everyone in the subreddit. Staking is a concept in cryptocurrency, specifically applicable to proof-of-stake blockchains, that involves holding a certain number of tokens to help secure the network and earn rewards. The purpose of staking is to incentivize users to participate in the network’s operations, such as transaction verification or block validation. By staking their tokens, users contribute to the network’s security and decentralization. One of the main rewards of staking is earning additional tokens as a form of interest or dividend. This allows holders to passively generate income on their cryptocurrency investments. The rewards are often distributed proportionally amongst stakers, based on factors like the number of tokens staked or the duration of staking. However, staking also involves some potential risks. One significant risk is the locking up of funds for a predetermined period. During this time, the staked tokens are generally inaccessible for trading or other purposes. It is important to consider this illiquidity when deciding to stake because it can limit one’s ability to respond to crypto market conditions or take advantage of other investment opportunities. Additionally, there is a risk of losing the staked tokens if the network experiences a security breach or other technical issues. While staking is designed to enhance the network’s security, no system is entirely immune to vulnerabilities. It is essential to carefully evaluate the network’s reputation, security measures, and protocol stability before engaging in staking activities. Read also: Staking vs. Yield Farming.

Title: How Molly White morphed from a Neopets nerd into crypto’s truth-teller – DL News
Date: Date not available
Content:
About us Copy link  The clock is ticking for Molly White. Any day now — the crypto researcher doesn’t know when — the Federal Election Commission could act on a complaint she filed against Coinbase in August. Working with Public Citizen, a consumer rights group, White accused the US crypto exchange giant of violating campaign finance laws as it raised $25 million for a crypto political action committee. Coinbase rejected her allegations, and now the matter is in the hands of officials. However it shakes out one thing is certain — White, a 31-year-old software engineer with 122,000 followers on X, has come a long way. Since making snarky comments about rug pulls three years ago, White has now become an inconvenient truth-teller in an industry eager to shake off the taint of scandal and appeal to the mass market. And by taking on the likes of Coinbase, a company with a $41 billion market value, and rolling out an online tracker for crypto campaign cash, she’s jumped into the heart of one of the biggest stories of the year. ‘I’m used to getting this sort of criticism and the hate that comes with it.’ Even as Wall Street coopts digital assets and crypto industry stalwarts curry favour in Washington, White is championing a vision of the web as an organic, grassroots space that prizes creativity instead of crass commercialisation. “The projects that promised to democratise finance have either failed or produced nothing of value,” White said in a wide-ranging interview with DL News. “With the markets down, most of the interest these days is just very financial — it’s memecoin speculation, it’s Bitcoin ETFs. There’s a lot less starry-eyed pushback against Big Tech.” White’s critics — and there are many — may see her as precisely that, a starry-eyed, even naïve, pundit who fails to grasp the business imperatives of the digital assets industry. White doesn’t pull her punches. She has characterised blockchain technology as a “solution looking for a problem” and has lamented how ordinary investors are regularly hurt by dodgy outfits selling “the dream of financial freedom.” Yet White is now backing up her zingers with action. First, she launched a website called Follow the Crypto in July to track the crypto industry’s outsized spending on elections. Molly White speaking at Web Summit in Lisbon in 2022. Photo by Sam Barnes/Web Summit via Sportsfile  She’s also written articles to question narratives that industry stalwarts like Coinbase and Ripple are spinning around the 2024 US general election. This year, the crypto industry has raised $174 million in campaign contributions for favoured candidates, which is second only to Big Oil, according to Federal Election Commission records. While all this cash is meant to defang the Biden Administration’s crackdown on the industry, it’s also animated the idea that crypto supporters will vote as a bloc on November 5. White rejected the notion as a myth. “There’s this story that there are all these voters out there who think crypto is a make-or-break issue, and if a candidate came out in support of crypto they would win the vote,” White said. “I don’t think that’s true. People care about the price of groceries or whether they can afford a house.” Meanwhile, her own clout is rising. In 2022, she advised aides to Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, on crypto legislation. In one of the many profiles that have appeared in mainstream publications, The Guardian newspaper called her “the sanest critic of the crypto frenzy.” White has drawn the ire of many in the crypto-verse, and often their posts are sexist. In August, an X user called her “another childless cat lady.” ‘A lot of the web3 pitch resonated with me. I was like, ‘Yeah, we do need to fix the web!’’ And in July, Messari co-founder Ryan Selkis said that while he respected White as a critic he also felt “there was a hate in you… a hate from feminism that’s lied to you and made you empty.” White shrugs off the trolls. “I’m used to getting this sort of criticism and the hate that comes with it,” she said. “I’ve always had a pretty thick skin for that kind of thing.” In person, White cuts a rebellious figure. She favours jeans and sleeveless T-shirts and sports an undercut that would bring a knowing smile from Cressida, the camera-toting character in the Hunger Games films. White fell in love with the web after discovering Neopets, the online game where users care for virtual pets. Keen on writing and research, White started editing Wikipedia when she was 13. She focused on Wikipedia articles chronicling the rise of the alt-right, and served on the site’s dispute resolution committee. She still helps maintain the site and edits the occasional entry. Neopets, an online game where users played with virtual pets, sparked Molly White's love for the web.  Along the way, her passion for what she calls the “infinite canvas” of the web deepened. “You remember the first time when you felt the web was magic?” she said when opening a presentation at the XOXO Festival in August. One of the reasons she got into crypto in 2021 was the hope web3 would counter the dominance of social media giants and corporate media. “A lot of the web3 pitch resonated with me,” White said. “I was like, ‘Yeah, we do need to fix the web! We should make it more equitable and reduce the control that a couple of big platforms have over everyone’s online presence.’” But she was quickly disillusioned by the hype and theft running rampant in crypto. “Normal people were asking, ‘Should I be buying Dogecoin?’” she said. “It was this weird, divorced-from-reality moment.” That year she launched a blog called Web3 is Going Just Great, which tracked rug pulls and heists among other issues. When the crypto industry started building a war chest to influence the 2024 election, White shifted gears. By January, Coinbase, Ripple, Gemini, as well as private equity firm Andreessen Horowitz, had raised an unprecedented $85 million, much of it via a super PAC called Fairshake. It was a staggering amount of spending for such a small industry. So she delved into Fairshake’s funding. Allying with Public Citizen, a consumer rights group, White dug into campaign finance records and found what she said is evidence that Coinbase was violating campaign finance rules. In a complaint filed on August 1, White and Public Citizen said Coinbase had a government contract at the time it made a $25 million donation to Fairshake. They said this was prohibited and filed a complaint with the FEC. On August 5, Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, countered that Coinbase was not a federal contractor because the government paid the company with the proceeds of seized crypto. The FEC says federal contractors are defined as people paid with funds allocated by Congress. “Seized crypto assets are not Congressionally appropriated funds, period,” Grewal wrote in a post on X. Seized crypto assets are not Congressionally appropriated funds, period. There is nothing new in the FEC complaint filed by a self-described crypto critic and Public Citizen’s research director, but it is notable that there is no minimum bar to file such a complaint, and this one… Seized crypto assets are not Congressionally appropriated funds, period. There is nothing new in the FEC complaint filed by a self-described crypto critic and Public Citizen’s research director, but it is notable that there is no minimum bar to file such a complaint, and this one… Grewal also called White’s complaint “misinformation” and dismissed her as someone “with no election law expertise and funded by who exactly?” Surprised at Grewal’s condescending tone, White replied that she’s independent and supported by individual donations. “Stooping to innuendo about who is ‘funding me’ is beneath you,” she posted. White amended her complaint to include Grewal’s rebuttal. An FEC spokesperson told DL News the agency does not comment on pending matters. Now, with the election fast approaching, White is turning her focus to social media and “digital sovereignty.” “I want to write on how to establish a presence on the internet that is not controlled by Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg,” she told DL News. White is unabashed about casting the stakes as existential. “If we want a truer democracy where people’s voices are roughly equal,” she said, “we shouldn’t be able to have billionaires donating huge, huge amounts of money when ordinary people can’t have that kind of influence.” Joanna Wright writes about policy for DL News.

Title: Bitnomial Exchange Sues U.S. SEC for Over Extending Its Crypto Jurisdiction
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by Crypto exchange Bitnomial filed a suit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), saying the regulator overextended its jurisdiction in seeking to regulate a proposed XRP futures contract together with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). "The SEC asserted that XRP Futures are security futures, which are subject to joint SEC and CFTC jurisdiction (unlike non-security futures which are subject only to the CFTC’s exclusive jurisdiction)," the company said in a Thursday filing with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. "The SEC further asserted that Bitnomial is required to comply with a host of additional SEC requirements before listing XRP Futures, including the significant task of registering as a national securities exchange ('NSE') and submitting to the SEC’s jurisdiction." In the filing the company said the futures fall solely in the CFTC's remit and the SEC's involvement would add significantly to the company's regulatory burden. The exchange self-certified that the XRP futures did not violate the CFTC's regulations on Aug. 9, it said. "Bitnomial disagrees with the SEC’s view that XRP is an investment contract and, therefore, a security, and that XRP Futures are thus security futures," it said in the filing. Bitnomial's case alleging SEC overreach follows a similar filing by Crypto.com on Tuesday. In that suit, the exchange said it was responding to a SEC warning that it was considering an enforcement action, and it was taking "a warranted response to the SEC's regulation by enforcement regime which has hurt more than 50 million American crypto holders." The SEC has contended in the past that Ripple has violated securities laws by selling the XRP token. In August a federal judge ruled that Ripple should pay $125 million after finding last year that the company had violated federal securities laws with its sale of XRP to institutional clients, but the judge said it selling XRP to retail clients through secondary markets didn't violate those laws. The penalty was a fraction of the $2 billion that the SEC sought and the regulator is now appealing the case.

Title: Crypto Analyst Says 1,400%+ Price Surge for One Ethereum Rival Not As ‘Crazy as It Sounds’ - The Daily Hodl
Date: Date not available
Content:
A widely followed analyst and trader says that an exponential rally for one of Ethereum’s (ETH) biggest rivals could be around the corner. The analyst pseudonymously known as Kaleo tells his 651,800 followers on the social media platform X that the price action of Avalanche (AVAX) over its first four years mirrors Ethereum’s during the same timeframe. “If similar price action continues to play out, an upside target of $400 AVAX isn’t as crazy as it sounds.” Avalanche, which is trading at $26.19 at time of writing, would have to go up by 1,427% from the current level to reach $400. However, Kaleo says that Avalanche and Ethereum have some differences despite their price action mirroring each other’s at similar periods of their lifetime. “ETH didn’t have a similar level of competition for capital from other layer-one ecosystems as AVAX has currently. Conversely, there’s more capital in the market as a whole than there was at this point of the previous cycle. ETH had multiple narratives that really led its push higher – Decentralized Finance (DeFi) & non-fungible tokens (NFTs). What will AVAX’s narrative be? Currently, it looks like it’s the layer-one launchpad narrative (e.g. look at the recent partnerships and launches they’ve announced over the course of the past year). Can it continue to make those type of partnerships? More importantly, can it find its own catalyst outside of that?” Kaleo further says that while it’s not guaranteed that Avalanche will enjoy similar growth to Ethereum’s in its early years, “proper executive and momentum in the right market conditions” would make it more likely.

POPCAT is a recent addition to the cryptocurrency landscape, aiming to inject new life into a market facing challenges like inactive wallets and market volatility. The coin is designed to address common issues such as pump and dumps and rug pulls by promoting transparency and security. Utilizing innovative blockchain technology, POPCAT seeks to provide fast and secure transactions. In the current market cycle, where investors are searching for promising opportunities, POPCAT presents itself as an attractive option. Its potential to deliver significant returns makes it a coin of interest for those looking to explore new ventures in the digital asset space. NEIRO ($NEIRO) is a new cryptocurrency with a total supply of 1 billion tokens. It has zero buy and sell taxes and no team tokens, promoting a community-driven approach. NEIRO positions itself as the next big opportunity in the crypto space, similar to Dogecoin’s rise. Its zero transaction fees and fair token distribution aim to attract users looking for a decentralized and community-focused project. In the current market cycle, NEIRO’s features may appeal to investors seeking new and promising cryptocurrencies. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency token inspired by Dogecoin but differentiates itself by operating on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB began with a quadrillion tokens. Half of the supply was sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, who donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned the rest, reducing the total supply by 40%. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum allows for developments like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and future plans for an NFT platform and DAO-based governance. These features contribute to its potential utility in the crypto space. In the current market cycle, SHIB’s expanding ecosystem may attract investors. While POPCAT, NEIRO, and SHIB have attracted attention, their short-term potential appears limited. DOGEN stands out as a token for those pursuing excellence, promising significant growth and tangible benefits for early adopters. With an expected 700% presale increase and a strong community focus, DOGEN may offer exceptional returns in the current altcoin season. Site: https://dogen.meme/

Title: DoJ, SEC charge ‘crypto’ market makers with market manipulation
Date: Date not available
Content:
A handful of ‘crypto’ market makers (MMs) have been charged with market manipulation and fraud for artificially inflating the fiat price of a handful of memecoins but also—gasp!—the mighty BTC. On October 9, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts announced charges against 14 individuals and four entities accused of “widespread fraud and manipulation in the cryptocurrency markets.” The feds seized over $25 million worth of tokens along with “multiple” trading bots used in the wash trading of certain tokens, while around 60 different tokens “have been deactivated.” Operation Token Mirrors got help from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS:CI) unit, and elements of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), along with agencies in Portugal and the United Kingdom. Four of the companies—Lillian Finance, Robo Inu Finance, Saitama, and VZZM—were ‘crypto’ firms that issued and promoted tokens. The MMs—Gotbit Consulting, CLS Global FZC, MyTrade MM, and ZM Quant—are accused of artificially pumping the trading volume of these tokens to give the impression of retail trader interest that would lure in actual retail traders on whom to dump these worthless coins. Incredibly, three of the MMs—CLS Global, MyTrade and ZM Quant—stand accused of wash trading on behalf of a company/token that the FBI created for the express purpose of giving the MMs something to artificially pump. The charged individuals face up to a couple of decades behind bars if convicted on charges of market manipulation, fraud, and conspiracy (to commit wire fraud/market manipulation/money laundering/conduct an unlicensed money transmitting business). We’ll get to the gory details in a second, but it’s worth noting that these indictments confirm the suspicions that have always surrounded the speculative token sector. Many of the centralized digital asset exchanges that gave these MMs free rein to ply their dark arts have featured on this site in less than savory situations, and they live down to their bad reputations in these indictments. Also, while most of the headlines surrounding these charges focus on the relatively inconsequential memecoins that were manipulated, the indictments cite instances of BTC trading volume being boosted by a factor of 16 over its legitimate volume. That may wound the delicate sensibilities of the BTC maximalists/snowflakes who choose to believe their utility-devoid token is above these shenanigans, but as they say at the poker table, read ‘em and weep. Gotbit got bit According to its indictment, the Belize-registered Gotbit promoted “purportedly legitimate services” on its website while “privately offering clients illegal services including market manipulation.” In February 2022, Russia-based Gotbit execs Fedor Kedrov and Qawi Jalili, Robo Inu’s Vy Pham, and other unidentified co-conspirators created a private chatroom on the Telegram messaging platform. Messages gleaned from this chatroom include Pham telling Gotbit to “slowly increase the volume” of Robo Inu token trades so it would be “trending on cmc” (token price tracker CoinMarketCap). Gotbit staff responded by saying they would do this “gradually” to make it look as if the demand was “organic.” In January 2023, Gotbit was told to boost Robo Inu’s volume on the Bitmart exchange to “above 1.1mil daily,” to which Kedrov responded, “Sure, will be done.” Another Gotbit staffer warned against raising the volume by too much too quickly “because CMC itself can detect suspicious activity in the market and exclude volumes from bitmart.” Similar discussions continued through the spring of 2024, including Pham telling Gotbit staff that “the basic goal right now is to create that FOMO [fear of missing out] by looking as organic volume.” Jalili responded affirmatively, saying, “we have good connections with Bitmart.” When Pham requested an “official agreement” detailing the manipulation, Jalili reminded Pham that certain jurisdictions are “kinda regulated […] we’re not going to be having those things very clearly stated.” Nonetheless, a contract was duly drawn up, stipulating that Gotbit would perform the desired tasks, for which it would receive $15,000 for three months of activity on a single exchange, plus 20% of the net profit generated by the fraudulent trades, and 2% of the token liquidation generated. An FBI agent’s affidavit details an August 2019 YouTube interview in which Gotbit founder/CEO Aleksei Andriunin said he’d developed code to artificially inflate the trading volume of tokens to have these tokens graduate to trading on larger exchanges. Andriunin kept business records detailing Gotbit’s “created volume” of certain tokens vs. their actual volume. In one 285-day period between November 2018 and August 2019,  the ‘created’ volume of the BTC token on behalf of Gotbit clients was 16x higher than its actual volume. Similarly, garish discrepancies were tracked for multiple other tokens, including BNB, the in-house token of the Binance exchange.   This was a lucrative activity, as the FBI tracked over $42 million in transfers to a Gotbit digital wallet since September 2022. Millions of these dollars were later transferred to Andriunin’s personal Binance account and then transferred off the exchange to other wallets under Andriunin’s control. In that YouTube interview, Andriunin fully acknowledged that Gotbit engaged in wash trading and scoffed at potential repercussions, saying Russia lacked specific crypto laws and that Andriunin didn’t work on any projects in the U.S. But in 2022, Andriunin posted a tweet saying the Gotbit “team has already stormed into the US to actively participate in” a New York crypto conference. The following year, Andriunin celebrated Gotbit launching an ‘Accelerator’ in California. Saitama drama Gotbit later performed similar pumps for the Saitama token on the Lbank and XT.com exchanges, helping to boost Saitama’s overall market cap to around $7.5 billion.   The Saitama indictment contains Telegram messages from July 2021 in which Saitama manager Russell Armand discusses plans to “create an illusion of massive buys and new holders as [Telegram] gets flooded” that will “incite ppl to buy more.” Armand instructed other Saitama executives involved in this deception to buy “2-3T per transaction, not big chunks. W[e] want list of small buys to look like it’s mor[e] buyers.” After this was done, Armand stated “If nothing else we did create hype and added holders.” By 2023, Saitama had enlisted Gotbit’s help in pumping the token. Throughout, Saitama execs were dumping their tokens on unsuspecting retail suckers, generating “tens of millions of dollars in proceeds.” In May 2024, FBI agents posing as investors from a crypto firm met with an LBank employee, who told the agents the exchange could (in the agent’s words) “introduce cryptocurrency companies to MMs and that the MMs can increase the trading volumes of cryptocurrencies.” The following month, the same LBank staffer explained how MMs like Gotbit could “generate volume through wash trades,” after which the agents set up a Telegram group chat with the LBank staffer and a Gotbit employee. ZM Quant: Pumping ‘pretty easy’ The incestuous nature of these crypto crimes means the indictment against the British Virgin Islands-based ZM Quant Investment loops in many of the same characters/companies. But there are a few details worth describing in depth. The DoJ says ZM Quant earned over $3 million in two years starting in 2022 by manipulating certain tokens on centralized exchanges—including, yet again, Bitmart—on behalf of their issuers. In a Telegram chatroom focused on token issuer VZZN, ZM Quant staffer Ruiqi Liu (aka Ricky Lau) provided VZZN with information most definitely not featured on ZM’s public website. This included rates for “creating volume” on decentralized exchanges Uniswap and Pancakeswap, as well as the use of a “trading bot” to “create volume” and provide “a good and continuous candle chart.” In March 2024, Liu told Saitama executives that pumping tokens on Uniswap was “pretty easy,” involving up to “two thousand wallets,” each of these transacting “maybe ten times each hour or ten times every minute.” Once an artificially inflated token “hit the top gainer on Uniswap the users will come to trade […] they will chase the price.” That same month, Liu told Saitama executives that ZM Quant would coordinate to “cash out at the peaks,” i.e., sell the pumped-up tokens at their highest price to retail suckers. Liu claimed to be coordinating this activity for multiple token issuers. Into this fine mess walked the undercover FBI agents with their stated plans to launch their own Ethereum-based project and token ‘NexFund AI.’ A new Telegram group was formed, and in April 2024, ZM Quant executive Baijun ‘Eric’ Ou submitted a ‘service agreement’ for the undercover agents to peruse. Liu suggested they first launch NexFund AI on an Ethereum ‘test net,’ and over 300 ‘test trades’ were conducted between May 23-30. On May 31, Liu sent a list of the wallets ZM Quant would use to pump the token on Uniswap, clarifying that “for 100k volume, we make 1000 transactions,” each of which “will cost about $3.” Uniswap traders began trading the NexFund AI token that same day using the ZM Quant wallets. The fake trades continued until the FBI “disabled” the token’s trading function prior to dropping the indictments. CLS Global creates the FOMO ZM Quant wasn’t the only MM to which the feds took their honeytrap token. The UAE-registered CLS Global’s indictment shows that it connected with the undercover agents in June 2024 based on a referral from an LBank staffer. CLS staffer Andrey Zhorzhes joined a Telegram group populated by “several purported NexFund AI promoters.” In July, Zhorzhes told the promoters that CLS could provide “volume creation” via “an algorithm” that directed multiple wallets to “self-trade” in a way that “looks like organic buying and selling that is happening.” (For instance, CLS promoted $DADDY, the token issued by professional misogynist Andrew Tate.) Zhorzhes promised this system was “very hard to track … We’ve been doing that for many clients.” Putting all his cards on the table, Zhorzhes said, “I know that it’s wash trading and I know people might not be happy about it.” Again, Zhorzhes said the goal was “to create the FOMO.” Zhorzhes suggested that CLS could help NexFund AI “meet exchange requirements” for token listing. Zhorzhes later humble-bragged about getting a client’s token listed on KuCoin while helping another customer elevate their token from the now-defunct Bittrex to Binance. On July 4, Zhorzhes sent the NexFund AI promoters a ‘license agreement,’ and the bogus trading began on Uniswap on August 23. By August 30, there’d been over $210,000 in trading volume, of which less than $8,000 was “organic volume.” On September 5, the feds shut down the token’s trading function. MyTrade’s mastermind The NexFund AI trap also ensnared the BVI-registered MyTrade, which had deals with centralized exchanges, including (who else?) Bitmart, Bibox, and the now-defunct BTCEX, as well as numerous decentralized exchanges. MyTrade was a little more blatant than the others, with its ‘Volume Support’ service openly promising token issuers the ability to “specify daily minimum and maximum trading value and the bot will trade randomly within this range with no loss besides exchange trading fees.” MyTrade’s ‘Self Trade’ feature—aka wash trades—generated trades between a client’s token and Tether’s USDT stablecoin. (C’mon, you didn’t think we’d get through a crypto crime story without a Tether reference, did you?) Founder Liu ‘David’ Zhou aka ‘DZ’ bragged to the undercover feds that he was the “mastermind” behind MyTrade and openly promoted his ‘volume bot’ as perfect for executing “pump and dumps.” But DZ chose to view his criminality as altruism, saying his wash trades helped “solve the cold start problem.” DZ praised decentralized exchanges for their ability to “show that there is continuous trading activity every hour on Ethereum … instead of nobody trading for the whole day.” MyTrade even provided (for a price) advice on how to conduct more lucrative pump-and-dumps. DZ said the whole strategy behind MMs like his was finding “other buyers from the community, people you don’t know about or don’t care about,” on whom to dump these worthless digital Beanie Babies. The cynical prick said he could create a trading volume that “looks like really nice roller coaster ride, and that’s where sometimes people jump in … but we have to make them lose money in order to make profit and get the listing fee back.” The feds say that on a single day (October 2), MyTrade “made millions of dollars’ worth of wash trades for approximately 60 clients until the bots were deactivated at the direction of law enforcement.” Illegitimi non carborundum Some of the individuals cited above have already entered their guilty pleas, while those outside the reach of U.S. authorities and their counterparts in extradition-friendly jurisdictions remain at large—and likely to re-offend. There’s far more to this sordid tale—we haven’t even mentioned the civil complaints filed against CLS, Gotbit, ZM Quant, Saitama, and Robo Inu by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). But we think you get the picture. It’s not a pretty picture. But it’s what you get when blockchain backers prioritize short-term profits over long-term utility. It’s funny how much angst has been generated by the recent HBO documentary claiming to have uncovered the real-world identity behind Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. Satoshi’s writing leaves no doubt that he/she had bigger plans for enterprise blockchain technology than issuing chips in a rigged crypto casino. ‘Crypto’ may have been taken over by hucksters from the Star Wars cantina, but there are a few of us who still honor Satoshi’s vision of a world-beating technology. So, take that famous mock Latin phrase to heart, and don’t let these wash trading, price-manipulating, pump-and-dumping, retail-screwing bastards get you down.

Date: Date not available
Content:
Pop icon Justin Bieber has amassed a sizable cryptocurrency portfolio since his foray into the non-fungible token (NFT) arena in 2021.  What happened: A wallet linked to Bieber received over $2 million in Ethereum ETH/USD from an NFT project named InBetweeners, which he used to bag blue-chip collectibles like Bored Apes and Mutant Apes.  Bieber’s wallet continues to retain value, holding around 146.478 Ether as of this writing, worth $353,575 at a per unit price of $2,413.85, as per data from Arkham Intelligence. Bieber's Ether stash has remained unchanged this year, meaning his portfolio was worth $335,720 on Dec. 31, 2023, at a market price of $2,291.95. Consequently, the music sensation has earned a return of $17,854 on Ether this year, equating to 5.3%. See Also: Satoshi Nakamoto Identity Remains A Mystery After HBO Documentary: Bronze Statue Celebrates Bitcoin Founder’s Anonymity – ‘We Are All Satoshi’ Why It Matters: While Bieber's cryptocurrency portfolio included other tokens like Apecoin APE/USD, the majority of the exposure was to the second-largest cryptocurrency.  There hasn't been any outward movement of cryptocurrencies from Bieber's wallet in over two years, around the time that he bought the original Bored Ape in early 2022.  The Canadian music sensation belonged to the elite list of celebrities with a large social media following and a sizable cryptocurrency portfolio. He currently ranks second in terms of holdings among celebrities with over one million followers, trailing former U.S. president Donald Trump.  Price Action: At the time of writing, Ether was exchanging hands at $2,413.85, up 0.34% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.   Image by Budiey on Flickr Read Next:  © 2024 Benzinga.com.

Title: Mark Cuban and Elon Musk Agree That This One Crypto Investment Is No Joke
Date: Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 6:05 AM
Content:
Mark Cuban and Elon Musk are two of the world’s most famous billionaires — and recently, the “Shark Tank” shark and the brash and outspoken Tesla boss have found themselves publicly at odds. Musk has emerged as one of Donald Trump‘s most prominent political surrogates, while Cuban has endorsed Kamala Harris. When Cuban said he’d buy Musk’s X social media platform “in a heartbeat” if he had the money, Musk mocked him with a laughing emoji. Trending Now: Warren Buffett Reveals How To Invest $10,000 If You Want To Get Rich For You: 7 Reasons a Financial Advisor Can Grow Your Wealth in 2024 But one thing that unites the two adversarial one-percenters is their longtime advocacy for and ownership of cryptocurrency. Furthermore, both are looking very seriously at a token that started as a joke. Trending Now: Boomers Hold Half of U.S. Wealth--So Why Are Thousands Living Without Homes? Software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer created the cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2013. They did so to lampoon the wild crypto speculation that dominated the market at that time by harnessing the satirical power of the meme culture that ruled early-2010s internet culture. However, after more than a decade in the crypto market news headlines, the open-source, p2p meme coin is no longer a laughing matter — at least not for Cuban and Musk. Its price history has been riddled with the same stomach-churning volatility that investors have come to expect from crypto, hitting a five-year low of $0.0015 and a five-year high of $0.68 before settling at today’s price of around $0.10 per token. However, no matter what you might think of Dogecoin as a long-term or speculative investment, the meme coin has matured into one of the most utilitarian digital tokens on the market. And, its potential as a legitimately useful real-world alternative currency has caught the attention of two of the three-comma club’s most famous members. Check Out: 5 Expert-Recommended Alternative Investments: How They Work and When To Invest Bloomberg recently chronicled the rise of Dogecoin as the go-to cryptocurrency for businesses looking to accept digital tokens for real-world payments. But why would everyone from Williamsburg Pizza in Brooklyn to University Sports Grill in Tempe, Arizona, choose a silly satirical coin over an established powerhouse like Bitcoin or Ethereum? Transaction speed and cost. Bloomberg writes, “Payments on the memecoin’s network are much faster and cost way less than many other cryptocurrencies. While transaction costs vary, the average fee is currently around 0.07 Dogecoin, or less than a penny.” Bitcoin transactions, on the other hand, cost the equivalent of $0.79. Similarly, Dogecoin has emerged as the crypto of choice for remittances. People living abroad have traditionally sent cash payments through financial retail businesses or international banks, where fees can top 7%, which gave lower-cost crypto an opening. However, Bitcoin remittance transaction times range from 10 minutes to one hour, while Dogecoin transactions take less than a minute, even across borders. As business owners have latched on to Dogecoin’s potential as the cryptocurrency with the most promising real-world potential, the billionaire celebrities have followed suit. In 2021, Cuban’s Dallas Mavericks NBA franchise began accepting Dogecoin as payment for tickets and merchandise. Bloomberg says Cuban estimates the team has accepted around 25,000 Dogecoin so far. Cuban also likes Dogecoin because its virality serves as an effective marketing tool, unlike competitors like Litecoin. Cuban told Bloomberg, “It’s an inexpensive way to become part of an incredibly vibrant online community.” Then there’s Musk, who has long shown an affinity for meme culture and frequently engages with Dogecoin-related accounts on his X platform. In fact, he’s been so vocal in his advocacy that investors sued him for artificially inflating DOGE’s price by posting about it so frequently. In August, a judge dismissed that case. Recently, Musk said he was considering reinstating Dogecoin as an official payment method for Tesla merchandise, which it was until the company disallowed crypto payments earlier in 2024. Now that he’s become a close confidant of Trump, Musk has floated the idea of leading a new Department of Government Efficiency if Trump wins a second term in office. Naturally, the hypothetical department’s acronym would be DOGE.

Title: Questions NOT to ask a crypto investor | HackerNoon
Date: Date not available
Content:
You’re at the dinner table, the BBQ is sizzling, or you're small talking with colleagues at work - suddenly, conversation stalls. Heads turn toward you, the resident crypto enthusiast, and before you know it, someone asks the inevitable: “So… how’s that crypto looking?” If you’ve ever convinced anyone to join Team Crypto, this scenario is all too familiar. Sometimes, the questions asked make for a great debate, but other times, they’re simply naive or misinformed.       “When will the bull run start?” This question would make any seasoned crypto investor squirm. Crypto trading can be thrilling, but it’s also unpredictable.    While understanding the overall trend the asset cycle follows is important, there’s simply no surefire formula for predicting when the next bull run will kick off. Importantly, it’s rarely smooth sailing within each market phase, and there might be rallies, reactions, and a lot of volatility on (hopefully) the way up.    Recently, even the Federal Reserve's decisions - slashing rate cuts by 50 basis points instead of the expected 25 - have had investors rethinking everything. From global economic shifts to geopolitical events (presidencies, wars, pandemics—take your pick), market confidence can be a wild card. Prices can skyrocket or plummet overnight. The key is: don’t invest more than you can afford to lose and always have a strategy - whether that’s taking profits at a certain price or building a long-term savings pot. Do your own research, and if you’re still unsure, consult a pro.    “Isn’t crypto for criminals and all just a scam?” Ah, the age-old stereotype. Sure, in the Wild West (beginning) days of Bitcoin, crypto had its fair share of publicity around shady dealings. But the space has evolved - in leaps and bounds. Crypto today powers everything from secure, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to cross-border remittance systems and even helps emerging economies bypass failing financial systems.    The truth is that blockchain’s transparent, immutable public record of transactions (ledger) is often the last place a criminal would want to hide. With growing regulation and strict Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, using a reputable exchange for your crypto transactions helps to keep your assets - and identity - secure. (TLDR: crypto is for everyone, not just for criminals!)    “So, can you buy me a coffee with it?” Oh boy, this is a goodie! While yes, more and more places do accept crypto (and yes, you can technically buy a coffee with Bitcoin!), that’s not the only point. Besides a myriad of everyday uses, it’s useful to think of crypto as an investment vehicle and long-term store of value - like gold, but in digital form. While the idea of paying for your daily latte with crypto sounds cool, most investors aren't exactly splashing their BTC or ETH on cappuccinos. It's more about building wealth, not spending it on coffee. (As a side note - it’s worth looking into stablecoins as a great ‘middle ground’ between fiat and crypto.)    “Should I put my life savings into crypto?” This is the ultimate eyebrow-raiser when it comes to crypto queries. No seasoned investor would recommend tipping your entire life savings into any single asset class - especially one that can be as volatile as crypto. As exciting as bull runs can be, crypto is a high-risk, high-reward game, and getting sound advice about diversification is a good idea.    “Is crypto just a bubble waiting to burst?” This question reflects classic skepticism. While there have been bubbles (hello, 2017!), crypto has matured and is now backed by serious institutional interest, from hedge funds to tech giants. (Most big tech advancements have seen bubbles on the way to mainstream adoption.) Blockchain technology isn’t going anywhere, and whether or not you buy into the hype, the underlying tech is here to stay.    Which crypto should I buy? There’s more to crypto than just Bitcoin, and each type has its own purpose and value, but it’s difficult to tell someone which to buy as this is deeply personal. This is why doing your own research is so important. Exploring different cryptocurrencies helps you understand which ones fit your goals and how they work together in the larger digital economy. This is no different from analyzing what shares to invest in. You should ask how long the company/token has been around and what its use case is and investigate its product-market fit, track record, and team.    One final takeaway Crypto is exciting, fast-paced, and constantly evolving - but it’s not about instant wealth or dodging criminals. Next time the conversation goes quiet, and you’re tempted to ask your crypto-savvy friend something, why not steer clear of these landmines and think about adding something more interesting to the debate on crypto’s potential or latest interesting use cases?

Title: Binance, Solana, Ethereum, Bitcoin and Lunex Network: Top Crypto News Of the Past Week
Date: 11. October 2024
Content:
The top crypto news this week makes for bleak reading. Binance Coin, Solana, Ethereum, and Bitcoin are all down. This was supposed to be a bull market, yet the top cryptos uniformly delivered red candles. The only green candle was from a new crypto presale token, Lunex Network which has given holders instant returns! While the top crypto news looks abysmal, the presale sector looks rosy! While the top crypto news this week highlights losses across major tokens, Lunex Network is defying the odds. This new crypto presale token is generating buzz for all the right reasons. Unlike the established players struggling in a downturn, Lunex is gaining momentum, offering a fresh opportunity for early investors. Lunex Network is a hybrid crypto exchange. Zero trading fees and a decentralized approach to trading stand out as a solid investment option, even in a bearish market. With tokens available at just $0.0013, Lunex Network proves that not all crypto news is bleak, and new crypto presales are where the action is. Coming in at the best of the worst performers, Binance Coin lost only about 1% in the last week. The type of loss Solana wishes it had. Binance did relatively well because it is an exchange token, and exchanges tend to be profitable even in market downturns. The short and medium forecast for Binance Coin looks good, but Binance Coin is not expected to give dizzying returns. Still, you could do worse than Binance Coin. You could be in Ethereum. A mere six months ago, Ethereum was flirting with $4k, and eager experts predicted a 5K all-time high. The top crypto news screamed headlines that Ethereum was shooting the moon. But Ethereum failed to launch. Ethereum has lost almost 8% in the last week and nearly 40% since March. In a bull market, Ethereum got mauled by bears. Still, it could be worse. It could be Solana. At a 10% loss this week, Solana is the biggest loser among the top cryptos. Solana has been slated as the Ethereum killer, but the only thing it has killed are its own dreams. But to be fair, even at Solana’s low price of around $145, Solana is still up 8x from where it was a year ago. Asking Solana to go higher may be implausible. Still, it could be worse. It could be XRP. Big daddy Bitcoin is responsible for all this market mayhem. Where Bitcoin goes, the others tend to follow – only faster. Bitcoin lost 2% over the last week, and if all goes well, the bottom has been reached, and now Bitcoin – and all the rest– will be going up. Here’s the silver lining: We’ve probably seen the last of the low-price bears, and from here on end, everything should be gravy for Bitcoin and the top altcoins. The top crypto news is that despite a horrible market, things are looking up. The bottom has been reached, and from now on, prices will rise. But if you are still cynical, you can hedge your bets by investing in the new crypto presale from Lunex, where tokens are now available at $0.0013.

Title: Former Customer of Crypto Exchange FTX Sues Olympus Peak, Says It Reneged on Bankruptcy Payout Deal
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by A California-based former customer of FTX is suing hedge fund Olympus Peak alleging that the firm's bankruptcy claims purchasing desk has withheld promised payments on a claim he sold to it. In documents filed with the U.S. District Court Southern District Of New York, Alexander Nikolas Gierczyk says he agreed to sell a $1.59 million FTX bankruptcy claim at a 42% discount to Olympus Peak Trade Claims Opportunities Fund with an "excess claim provision." The agreement provided that “if the Claim is ultimately allowed … in an amount that is greater than the Claim Amount, Buyer will purchase such Excess Claim Amount by paying … the Excess Claim Amount multiplied by the Purchase Rate.” Gierczyk agreed to the sale only because "the purchase agreement contained a clause that expressly gave him the right to receive additional recovery in the event his claim was paid above par through the bankruptcy proceedings," according to the filing. Gierczyk's attorneys write in the filing that the most recent FTX disclosure statement says that claims similar his are estimated to receive as much as 146% of their value in distributions. But, they allege, Olympus Peak, "made clear that they would not be fulfilling their end of the bargain.” "We disagree with your position that you have a retained any economic interest in the claim,” an Olympus Peak representative wrote to Gierczyk. Olympus Peak did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk. In the early days of FTX's bankruptcy, claims were going for 13 cents on the dollar on bankruptcy marketplaces. Bloomberg reported on the case earlier. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Title: 6 Best Altcoins to Lift Your Crypto Portfolio from $1,000 to $1 Million by 2026 - Brave New Coin
Date: Date not available
Content:
The cryptocurrency market never stands still, within the next few years growth opportunities may be considerable for those willing to take risks. Given the right selection of altcoins, a relatively small $1000 investment can be turned into an attractive portfolio worth $1 million by 2026. One additional launching project that is worth watching together with five other alts is Rexas Finance (RXS). Here’s a closer look at just six of them which are expected to see unprecedented growth in the coming years. At the top of this list sits Rexas Finance (RXS), a blockchain-based project that is revolutionizing RWA (real-world assets) tokenization. The current presale price of $0.06, in stage 4, leads us to understatement Rexas Finance has exceptional upside potential. Going by its recent performance, the project seems to be highly appealing to its investors since it has been able to realize millions of tokens presold within record time.Rexas Finance intends to tackle one of the fundamental problems existing in traditional markets – accessibility. The users of the platform will have the opportunity to buy portions of high-priced assets such as real estate, equipment, or even a share of artworks. It makes investment in such assets possible for a much larger pool of investors and brings investment opportunities that are usually covered by high-value assets and liquidity to the market.Funding is one of the core components of Rexas Finance thanks to its Launchpad feature which enables projects to raise funds through the sale of a new token. It has also incorporated an AI Generator that streamlines the creation and management of NFTs and tokenized assets for users having less technical know-how. Furthermore, Rexas Finance has stepped up its game with the recent promotion of $50,000 USDT which has attracted attention and new users enhancing the participation in the ecosystem further. Such innovative measures and broader market approaches do place Rexas Finance as one of the great dividend payers in the future. 2026 may be the expected year to see this coin potentially skyrocketing in value scaling prices of $10 and beyond. Avalanche(AVAX) is the fastest emerging layer 1 blockchain network specializing in technology censoring most users at the surface. Its infrastructure, AVAX, accomplishes its objective fast, and safely, and causes excessive scalability. It’s determined to cater to decentralized applications(dApps) and DeFi protocols. It possesses some of the fastest transaction rates due to its unique consensus mechanism while keeping the costs low thus endearing it to many developers. Avalanche is more likely to capture a huge market share as the DeFi space continues to expand and developers are in search of faster cheaper options to Ethereum. Currently priced under $10, an early investor of AVAX can rest assured that he will reap big as the price might shoot up several multiples of the current value by 2026.  Elrond (EGLD) is a blockchain designed for high-throughput transactions, focusing on enhancing network capacity and efficiency. With the Multi-tiered adaptive sharding and the SPoS consensus, Elrond has the ability to process even thousands of transactions at very low fees. This creates a formidable platform for DeFi and other web applications such as NFTs.Instead, it is the determination to build a fully developed market on the internet that differentiates the Elrond network. Currently trading at $20, EGLD price targets seem to be on an uptrend due to the growing number of dApps and DeFi projects sustainable growth. By 2026, Elrond is one of the projects that will make waves fairly, turning small investments into sizable fortunes. Algorand (ALGO) is a blockchain technology that stands for an unparalleled solution integrating sustainability, scalability, and security. With its Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism, fast transactions, and cheap fees fully on the Algorand platform, a variety of applications from DeFi to NFTs can be capable of operating efficiently on the platform.What is even more interesting about Algorand is its commitment to being eco-friendly which should draw some projects and investors who are green. The working relations that Algorand has, such as in the provision of central bank digital currencies together with governments and financial institutions, set it for a significant uptake. On a price of about $0.10, ALGO has upside room thus making it a wise investment to hold on to for several years possibly up to the year 2026. Kadena Coin is an extremely flexible blockchain solution type that has been created with real use cases in the real world in mind. It is a design based on chain web that enables scalability and generates high throughput, and extensive enterprise concentration puts Kadena up among the fastest-growing blockchain projects. The strongest point of Kalena is scalability without security loss—and it is a serious problem for many other blockchains.For years Kadena has been priced at less than 1 USD and presents a great investment opportunity for those who are seeking a blockchain model which when adopted savagely by institutional investment. With some sort of basic fundamentals in healthcare, DeFi, and supply chain, Kadena can have rapid growth in the next few years making it one of the best altcoins in terms of long-run profitability.  Theta Network (THETA) is a blockchain-based video or streaming platform that is implemented in a decentralized manner. The operating concept in getting rid of the traditional video streaming industry is to lower content delivery costs and reward those willing to offer their bandwidth and resources. Backed by such well-known partners as Google, Samsung, and Sony, Theta is striving to become a market leader in the decentralized video content delivery network.As usual, the sphere of entertainment and video streaming services is worth many billions of dollars and Theta is ready to obtain such a market as well. At under a dollar, THETA is an affordable purchase that can boost upwards by 10 times down to 20 times when the adoption of decentralized video streaming is realized by the year 2026. It is also worth noting that all these altcoins have a utility that would likely unlock substantially investors’ expectations in the years ahead. The crypto market is characterized by its price fluctuations but there is a high-risk element with a potential high reward. With the prospects of fast appreciation and good return on investment, these altcoins are ideal for anyone aiming at creating generational wealth.Rexas Finance (RXS) provides an ingenious method of asset tokenization whereby even the common investors can invest and earn fractional ownership of real-world assets that previously only the privileged had access to. With the aid of the AI Generator, and the Launchpad, Rexas Finance is looking to cut across various industries, and hence prepare for a boom in its price up to 2026.Moreover, Avalanche (AVAX) and Elrond (EGLD) target the aspect of scalability, speed, and cheaper transaction cost making these two have a fair competition in the quest of being the best platforms for developing Decentralized applications. Similarly, Algorand (ALGO) and Kadena (KDA) are addressing the three key aspects of efficiency, security, and also scalability for developers and enterprise users, which can potentially enable wide absorption in the markets.Theta Network (THETA) is changing the video streaming industry with the aim of decentralizing the conduct with efficient partnerships and the ability to deliver content in the foreseeable future.Thus, by acquiring these appealing altcoins, it is possible for anyone to earn considerable returns to make a well-balanced crypto investment one that started modestly developing to generate over a million dollars in a few years.

Title: Ripple Offers ‘Bank-Grade’ Custody Tech to Crypto Firms
Date: Date not available
Content:
Digital asset infrastructure firm Ripple has introduced new features and functionalities for its custody solution. “Custody is a key entry point into the digital asset economy, and it’s only growing,” Ripple said in a Thursday (Oct. 10) press release. The company notes that the amount of crypto assets custodied is projected to reach at least $16 trillion by 2030, by which time 10% of the world’s GDP is also expected to be tokenized. “As such, companies need secure, compliant and flexible options to store their crypto,” the release added. According to Ripple, the update includes a transaction screening service integration, added hardware security module options, an XRPL integration for tokenizing real world assets (RWA), pre-configured policy frameworks and upgrades to the platform’s usability and user interface. In addition, Ripple Custody now supports XRP Ledger tokenization features, letting businesses to tokenize and manage assets including cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, and real-world assets “while facilitating digital asset issuance and secure transfers directly from its platform,” the company added. PYMNTS examined the tokenization of RWA earlier this year, noting that it was another component of blockchain that has gotten the attention of players in the payments, finance and commerce worlds: the ability for organizations to denote ownership rights of a real-world asset as a digital, on-chain token. “Tokenized RWAs have the potential to make assets more liquid, accessible and efficient while enhancing transparency, security and global reach,” that report said. “Representing RWAs on the blockchain — such as real estate, private equity and venture investments, fine art and collectibles, physical commodities like gold, fixed income instruments, intellectual property assets and even stocks and equities — can transform the way ownership of assets is recorded and enable new functions.” In more recent tokenization news, PYMNTS spoke Thursday with Mastercard Chief Product Officer Jorn Lambert about how the technology could improve any use case where the exchange of data is the norm. It can boost more than commerce, he said, though the most obvious benefit is to merchants, issuers and customers. “We’ve needed to rethink, from the ground up, how we architect security,” Lambert said. In a world where credentials are stored on billions of mobile devices and could be stored on millions of servers globally, “you have to assume that the bad actors and the hackers will get their hands on that data, no matter how tall and thick the firewalls you build,” he added. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Digital Watch Observatory Digital Governance in 50+ issues, 500+ actors, 5+ processes Home | Updates | Crypto.com files lawsuit against SEC for exceeding authority The lawsuit, which follows a Wells Notice issued in August, also highlights the SEC’s failure to follow procedural steps, such as the notice and comment rulemaking process. Crypto.com has filed a lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), accusing the agency of overreaching its legal authority by classifying most crypto transactions as securities. The lawsuit follows a Wells Notice issued by the SEC in August, signalling potential enforcement action. Crypto.com argues that the SEC’s inconsistent regulatory approach, exempting Bitcoin and Ether, undermines the crypto sector’s future in the US. In its legal filing, Crypto.com claims the SEC bypassed essential procedural steps, including the notice and comment rulemaking process. The exchange aims to halt what it views as the agency’s ‘unlawful’ crackdown on cryptocurrency. Alongside the lawsuit, Crypto.com has petitioned the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for clearer regulation of cryptocurrency derivatives. Several crypto firms, including blockchain technology company Consensys, have also sued the SEC this year after receiving Wells Notices.

Compare their technologies, performance, and prospects, and chart your path through the crypto landscape. Avalanche vs ripple: Navigating the differences and similarities
The world of cryptocurrencies is as vast and diverse as the destinations on a global map. Blockchain technology offers a multitude of paths, each with its unique use cases. Just like travellers choose different modes of transport, crypto enthusiasts have a range of blockchain protocols at their disposal. Bitcoin is often seen as the reliable train, ideal for both payments and storing value. Ethereum, with its smart contracts, is akin to a bustling metropolis of decentralized applications. But there are other exciting routes to explore as well. Ripple’s ecosystem offers a smooth and efficient way to make payments in crypto, while Avalanche presents itself as a speedier alternative to Ethereum. As you embark on your crypto journey, getting to know both projects can help guide your decisions. You can find AVAX and XRP exchange at various crypto “stops” along the way. Technology and architecture: Choosing the right route
Though both Avalanche and Ripple are blockchain protocols, their inner workings are like choosing different vehicles for your trip. Avalanche employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where validators stake tokens for block rewards. What makes Avalanche stand out is its use of subnets, which function like regional routes allowing for independent transaction processing. Developers can even create their blockchain highways on top of Avalanche’s existing infrastructure. In contrast, XRP follows a custom route with its XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol. Here, validators don’t receive rewards, and they must be approved by the Ripple company—a network primarily comprised of universities, financial institutions, and registered exchanges. If you’re curious about other crypto pathways, projects like Helium or IOTA might interest you—leading you on an HNT to IOTA “road trip” to discover their unique consensus mechanisms. Market performance: The global spotlight 
When it comes to their “travel popularity,” both AVAX and XRP are major attractions, ranking among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. XRP, with a $34 billion market value, has been around since 2012, making it a seasoned veteran of the crypto world. AVAX, a newer contender launched in 2020, sits at a $20 billion market cap. Like popular travel destinations, the trading volume of XRP far exceeds that of AVAX, partially due to its established history. However, Ripple’s journey hasn’t been without obstacles, as regulatory scrutiny has impacted its performance. AVAX, by comparison, has experienced rapid growth, appreciating by 200% in the past 12 months, while XRP has seen more modest growth at 23%. It’s like comparing a newly discovered travel hotspot with an established, well-known destination—both have their appeal, depending on what kind of adventure you seek. Ecosystem and partnerships: The travel allies 
XRP has built a network of institutional partnerships much like a seasoned traveller collaborates with top travel agencies. From global payment giants like Santander and Visa to university alliances that advance blockchain research, Ripple’s ecosystem is a trusted network. Avalanche, while newer, is carving its path by teaming up with crypto initiatives that capitalize on its efficient blockchain. Ava Labs, the team behind Avalanche, has even joined forces with Amazon Web Services (AWS), allowing the blockchain to integrate into AWS’s infrastructure, akin to working with a top-tier travel service to optimize efficiency. Scalability and transaction speed: The road less traveled
When evaluating performance, both Avalanche and XRP offer high-throughput “routes,” but each has distinct strengths. Avalanche processes transactions faster, at 4,500 transactions per second (tps) and a 2-second block time. However, its average fee is higher at $0.05. XRP takes longer at 5-7 seconds per block and 1,500 tps but charges just $0.0002 per transaction. While Avalanche’s higher throughput is attractive for decentralized applications (DApps), the cost of microtransactions can add up. XRP, despite its slower speed, remains an excellent choice for payments, like choosing an affordable yet slower mode of travel. In a nutshell: Which crypto adventure will you choose?
Both AVAX and XRP have cemented their places in the crypto world, much like top travel destinations that remain popular year after year. While Avalanche has experienced better performance recently, Ripple’s established network and institutional support ensure that it will continue to thrive. Your decision on which “route” to take depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. As with any journey, it’s essential to do your research and stay aware of the risks—the crypto market, like a new destination, can be unpredictable. Only invest what you can afford to lose and enjoy the adventure as you explore the thrilling world of cryptocurrencies. © 1999 – 2023, TravelDailyNews Media Network • Reproduction of the content is allowed ONLY with clear reference to the TravelDailyNews International and a link back.

Title: Crypto whale loses $36M in major phishing scam causing DETH depeg
Date: Date not available
Content:
The phishing scam has been linked to the notorious wallet drainer, Angel Drainer. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Blockchain security firm Scam Sniffer reported that a crypto whale’s address was drained of 15,079 fwDETH, worth approximately $36 million, in a phishing scam. Data from Arkham Intelligence suggest that the phished address might be linked to the venture firm Continue Capital. The firm has yet to comment on the incident Meanwhile, Yu Xian, the founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist, linked the attack to the Angel Drainer phishing group, a known provider of “draining-as-a-service” (DAAS). Typically, wallet drainers supply scammers with phishing tools like fake social media accounts, websites, and others in return for a share of the stolen funds. In 2023, these phishing services contributed to the theft of $295 million from 324,000 victims. Phishing scams like this remain a persistent issue for the crypto sector. Scam Sniffer reported that such attacks caused losses of around $126 million in the third quarter of 2024 alone. The attack caused a significant disruption in DeFi markets, leading to the depegging of DETH, an asset meant to maintain a 1:1 exchange rate with ETH. On-chain analyst Ember CN revealed that the attacker swiftly swapped the stolen DETH for ETH through a decentralized exchange. However, the liquidity in the DETH pool was insufficient, resulting in the attacker receiving only 2,288 ETH of the 14,079 DETH sold. Nevertheless, the action drained the pool, causing a major decoupling between DETH and WETH. The value of the stolen assets plummeted by 85%, from $35.98 million to $5.5 million. In an Oct. 11 post on X, decentralized trading platform Duo Exchange acknowledged the phishing attack but assured users that its protocols remained safe and fully functional. It stated: “We are aware of the recent phishing attack on some of the whales of Duo. Over 10k DETH was dumped on AMMs to cause a depeg of DETH price.” According to DeFillama data, the total value of assets locked on the platform dropped sharply, falling to $86 million from $103 million in just one day.

Title: SEC Sues Crypto Market Maker Cumberland DRW
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Cumberland DRW was an unregistered securities dealer in a lawsuit Thursday, alleging the crypto market maker "bought and sold" cryptocurrencies that were sold as unregistered securities. The SEC alleged that Cumberland used its research reports and update emails to promote investments in different cryptocurrencies, naming Polygon's {{POL}} (formerly MATIC), Solana's (SOL), Cosmos' (ATOM), Algorand's (ALGO) and Filecoin's (FIL) as "a non-exhaustive list" of cryptos that were sold as securities. "Public statements by the issuers and promoters of the Cumberland-Traded Assets – including statements retransmitted by Cumberland and by the third-party crypto asset trading platforms that Cumberland uses – would have led objective investors to reasonably view the offer to purchase or sell of each of the Cumberland-Traded Assets as offers to purchase and sell investment contracts, which are securities pursuant to the federal securities laws," the SEC's complaint said. These investors expected to profit, the SEC alleged. However, Cumberland did not register as a securities dealer. The SEC, as it has in a few previous suits, went through the five example cryptocurrencies and laid out its arguments for how these assets look like securities, pointing to public statements from the projects' founders and white papers and Cumberland's own statements about the different assets. As one example, the SEC alleged, Cumberland promoted ATOM through, "An email sent to counterparties on February 20, 2023 stated: 'At the moment, one of the smaller gainers in the sector, outside of ETH and EOS, has been ATOM. ATOM is up ‘only’ 53% YTD, despite strong fundamentals and a healthy developer community; it’s a name where we expect to see a catchup rally if crypto remain buoyant.'" The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction and disgorgement of proceeds, the suit said. However, Cumberland pushed back against the suit on a social media post on X. "We are not making any changes to our business operations or the assets in which we provide liquidity as a result of this action by the SEC." "We are confident in our strong compliance framework and disciplined adherence to all known rules and regulations - even as they have been a moving target (it wasn't long ago ETH was claimed to be a security)," the post said.

Title: FBI Creates Crypto Token to Expose Fraud, Leads to Major Market Manipulation Charges - Brave New Coin
Date: Date not available
Content:
In a groundbreaking move, the FBI created its own cryptocurrency token, NexFundAI, to infiltrate and expose fraudulent actors within the crypto market.  The undercover operation, codenamed “Operation Token Mirrors,” has culminated in U.S. prosecutors charging 18 individuals and entities, including four major crypto firms—Gotbit, ZM Quant, CLS Global, and MyTrade—for alleged market manipulation and fraudulent trading practices. These firms are accused of engaging in widespread fraud, including “wash trading” schemes that misled investors and artificially inflated the value of over 60 cryptocurrencies. The FBI, known for its innovative tactics in combating crime, took the unprecedented step of establishing NexFundAI on the Ethereum blockchain. The bureau created a website for the token, designed to appear like any other cryptocurrency project, complete with detailed descriptions of the token’s purpose and potential. However, this token was a trap to attract fraudulent crypto firms that specialized in inflating trading volumes and prices for profit.  Source: NexFundAI via FBI “The FBI took the unprecedented step of creating its very own token and company to identify, disrupt, and bring these alleged fraudsters to justice,” stated Jodi Cohen, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Boston Division, in a press release. Wash trading, a practice where traders simultaneously buy and sell an asset to create artificial trading activity, is at the heart of the charges. The conspirators allegedly inflated the value of tokens like the Saitama Token, which once boasted a market capitalization of $7.5 billion. They then executed “pump and dump” schemes, manipulating prices upward to attract unwary investors before selling off their holdings at the inflated values, leaving investors with losses. The firms behind these fraudulent activities, including ZM Quant and Gotbit, are accused of facilitating this manipulation by hiring market makers to execute sham trades. These companies allegedly used multiple wallets and trading bots to conceal the true nature of their trades, inflating trading volumes and token prices without genuine market demand. In one instance, a ZM Quant employee described the wash trading strategy as a way to “make other buyers lose money in order to make a profit.” This scheme deceived investors into believing that the tokens were in high demand, prompting them to buy into the false hype.  Source: FBI Authorities have already seized over $25 million in cryptocurrency as part of the investigation and disabled several trading bots responsible for millions in fraudulent transactions. Several defendants have pleaded guilty or are in the process of negotiating plea agreements. Others have been apprehended in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Portugal. Assistant U.S. Attorney Joshua Levy emphasized that wash trading is illegal under U.S. financial regulations, and the same laws apply to the rapidly expanding crypto industry. “This operation is a significant step in cracking down on fraud in the digital asset space,” Levy said. “Wash trading has long been outlawed in traditional financial markets, and now we are holding crypto firms to the same standards.” The indictment, which includes evidence from Telegram and WhatsApp chats among the conspirators, paints a picture of sophisticated market manipulation. Some conversations involved the use of memes and gifs to celebrate the deceptive practices, adding a layer of irony to the operation.  The individuals and entities charged span the globe, with some of the more prominent figures including: – Aleksei Andriunin and Fedor Kedrov of Gotbit Consulting LLC – Riqui Liu and Baijun Ou of ZM Quant Investment LTD – Andrey Zhorzhes of CLS Global FZC, LLC – Liu Zhou of MyTrade MM These defendants now face serious penalties, including up to 20 years in prison for market manipulation and wire fraud. The case highlights the continued risks in the crypto market, where rapid innovation often outpaces regulatory oversight. The FBI’s sting operation serves as a warning to other fraudulent actors who may be tempted to exploit the unregulated nature of the space. Despite the success of “Operation Token Mirrors,” some crypto enthusiasts were quick to criticize the FBI for creating a token that, by design, entrapped those participating in the manipulation. Critics have pointed out the irony of the FBI calling for victims of this scam—who traded NexFundAI unknowingly—to come forward as victims of a crime. As the crypto market evolves, this case is likely to shape how authorities approach future enforcement actions. The industry, often likened to the “Wild West” of finance, may now face stricter oversight and heightened scrutiny as regulators catch up with the technology. For now, the defendants remain presumed innocent until proven guilty, but the operation signals a new chapter in the battle against crypto fraud. The FBI’s 2023 IC3 Cryptocurrency Report highlights over 69,000 cryptocurrency-related complaints, with losses exceeding $5.6 billion, marking a 45% increase from 2022. Investment frauds accounted for 71% of all losses. Other scams include tech support, extortion, and government impersonation. Criminals exploit crypto’s decentralized and irreversible nature for fraud and money laundering. The report stresses rapid complaint reporting and provides tips for avoiding scams. Older victims reported the highest losses, especially from confidence-enabled investment fraud. For more details, see the full report here.

Title: Best Crypto Presales to Buy Now - 1000x Potential for 2025-2026 - Brave New Coin
Date: Date not available
Content:
At its core, a crypto presale is an early fundraising mechanism used by blockchain projects to generate capital before launching their tokens on the open market. These presales offer users the chance to purchase tokens at a discounted rate, often before they become publicly available. This is then a critical time for both the project and potential believers. For the project, it’s an opportunity to secure funding, but also to build a community like the one around EarthMeta, and create a buzz around their offering. One of the main attractions of participating in crypto presale is the potential for substantial returns. Many users dream of achieving that magical 1000x return—the kind that turns a modest investment into a life-changing sum. But how exactly does this work? To understand this potential, you must first grasp the basic principle of buying low. To achieve a 1000x return, you need to acquire cryptocurrency at a very low price point. The formula is straightforward: if you buy a token for $0.10, for it to reach a value of $100, you have achieved that coveted return. However, the question remains: how do you find tokens that have the potential to rise significantly in value? First, most cryptocurrencies already have a significant number of tokens in circulation. This reality poses a challenge for new projects aiming for astronomical price increases. For a token to achieve a substantial valuation, it must create a sense of scarcity. Think of it this way: your favorite crypto isn’t going to jump from $0.10 to $10,000 overnight. – For a token to reach such heights, it would need to become a household name, recognized by the public, media, and governments alike. Currently, this level of recognition seems unlikely for most new projects. However, a more realistic scenario exists: your crypto could go from $0.50 to $500, and that’s where you can cash in on that 1000x return. This is where the concept of crypto presales becomes viral. Participating in pre sales allows you to purchase tokens at a ground rate before they hit the broader market. It’s an opportunity to secure your stake in projects that have the potential for substantial gains. However, not every presale is created equal. Some projects may simply aim for quick profits without delivering genuine value. Therefore, focusing on projects that aim to solve real problems or offer innovative solutions is important. Also, when it comes to a crypto strategy, diversification is key. However, it’s essential to keep your diversification manageable. Aiming for around 4 to 5 projects allows you to spread risk without becoming overwhelmed by too many investments. – By limiting the number of presales you participate in, you can maintain a clearer overview of your participation and engage more effectively with the communities behind them. This focused approach increases your chances of capitalizing on successful projects while minimizing the risks associated with potential failures. Conduct thorough research and remain vigilant. Monitor the performance of your chosen projects and be ready to adapt your strategy if necessary. The ability to pivot based on market conditions can help safeguard your investments. Stay informed about market trends and developments. Engage with the crypto community to understand the prevailing sentiments and identify potential opportunities. Being in tune with market dynamics can help you make informed decisions and position yourself for success. Participating in crypto presales can be an exciting journey, but it’s essential to approach it with a level head and a willingness to learn. By continuously educating yourself about the market, the technology, and the projects you invest in, you’ll position yourself for greater success in the long run.

Continuous development ensures the token will keep delivering value, supporting various activities while helping users manage and mitigate risks. Crypto All-Stars is a platform that brings a new concept to the cryptocurrency space by introducing the MemeVault Ecosystem. The aim is to create a unified ecosystem for holders of meme coins, where they can stake their assets and earn rewards using the platform’s native token, $STARS. Unlike traditional platforms that only support single-token staking, the MemeVault supports multi-token, multi-chain capabilities, thanks to the advanced ERC-1155 standard. This approach allows users to stake various meme coins on a single platform, making it more inclusive and efficient. The MemeVault Ecosystem is designed to maximize the potential of meme coins, enabling users to hold, stake, and earn rewards through $STARS. This process not only helps consolidate the diverse world of meme coins but also enhances user engagement by promoting an interconnected community. By holding $STARS, participants receive significant rewards, and their engagement helps drive the platform’s growth and adoption. Security and transparency are at the core of the MemeVault Ecosystem. The platform undergoes rigorous audits and uses secure, advanced technologies to ensure a safe environment for all users. The ERC-1155 standard enables seamless handling of multiple tokens, giving users the ability to manage their meme coin assets under one contract, while also enjoying enhanced scalability and efficiency. One of the key features of the platform is its reward potential. Users earn substantial rewards simply by holding $STARS, and those rewards increase with greater participation. This reward structure encourages positive momentum in the market, benefiting both individual users and the broader Crypto All-Stars community. Crypto All-Stars also provides exposure to the entire meme market, as it integrates many of the most popular meme coins within its ecosystem. This feature allows users not only to benefit from the growth of $STARS but also to explore and participate in the broader world of meme coins. By offering a unified, secure, and rewarding environment, Crypto All-Stars brings together meme coin enthusiasts and helps create a more vibrant and connected community. In conclusion, crypto presales offer significant potential for those willing to navigate the landscape thoughtfully. By focusing on projects that provide genuine value and maintaining a strategic approach to your investments, you can position yourself for meaningful returns. The crypto market is constantly evolving, and with diligent research and informed decision-making, you can pursue the goal of achieving that 1000x return during the next bull run. Consider your options carefully, engage with the communities behind these projects, and stay proactive in your investment approach. The opportunity to make significant gains exists, but it requires smart decisions, careful planning, and an understanding of the dynamics at play. So, are you ready to dive into the presale adventure? The next big winner could be just around the corner, waiting for you to take action.  Several cryptocurrencies, especially those in their early stages, have the potential to deliver massive returns. Projects focused on the metaverse, decentralized finance (DeFi), and artificial intelligence (AI) are especially well-positioned for significant growth. EarthMeta is an example, given its innovative approach to virtual land ownership. However, success depends on market adoption, development, and real-world utility, so it’s important to research thoroughly before investing. The top cryptocurrencies with 1000x growth potential often come from emerging sectors like the metaverse, gaming, or DeFi. Projects like EarthMeta and Avalanche (AVAX), which focus on scalability and real-world utility, could see explosive growth as the crypto market continues to evolve. It’s essential to focus on cryptos that introduce unique technology or solve significant issues within the blockchain ecosystem. New cryptos that are still in presale or early development stages have the highest likelihood of delivering 1000x returns. EarthMeta, with its presale phase and focus on owning and developing virtual cities, presents an opportunity for early investors. Similarly, other projects centered around emerging trends like AI and the metaverse are worth keeping an eye on as they could see massive price increases as they gain traction. To find the next 1000x crypto, look for projects in early stages that focus on innovative technology or high-demand sectors like the metaverse, gaming, or DeFi. You should examine the project’s whitepaper, development team, roadmap, and tokenomics. Platforms like EarthMeta, for example, are innovating in the virtual real estate space, but many other projects in gaming, AI, and DeFi also show promise. Early-stage cryptos that introduce groundbreaking technologies or unique use cases in industries like gaming, metaverse, or decentralized finance have high growth potential. EarthMeta is one of the notable early-stage projects that could deliver substantial returns by introducing virtual land as NFTs. Additionally, projects focused on decentralized applications and Layer 2 solutions could experience rapid growth as they gain adoption. Crypto presales like EarthMeta have significant potential to grow once they reach the public stage. Presales are attractive because they allow early investors to buy tokens at a discounted price. However, it’s important to research the project’s technology, team, and potential market demand before investing. Other presales that focus on high-demand areas like virtual reality, AI, and DeFi could also deliver massive returns. Low-cap cryptos, particularly those in rapidly growing sectors such as the metaverse and DeFi, have the potential to 1000x as they mature. EarthMeta is an example of a low-cap crypto that offers unique features in virtual city ownership, which could help it achieve significant growth. Other low-cap projects focused on scalability and decentralized applications are also worth watching. This is a sponsored article.

	Cryptocurrencies Price Prediction: Bitcoin, Cardano & Crypto – European Wrap 11 October

 Bitcoin (BTC) is finding support around the key level, and a close below this level could signal a decline. Ethereum (ETH) is approaching a critical resistance barrier; rejection from this level suggests a decline ahead. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is stuck in a range, reflecting a period of indecision among traders.  Cardano (ADA) recovers slightly to trade around $0.34 on Friday after declining 4% so far this week. Cardano’s ambassador Mauro Andreoli recently highlighted the milestone of Argentina’s first legally and judicially enforceable contract — a loan agreement for 10,000 ADA tokens, valued at $3,380 — which may set a precedent for the future legal recognition of blockchain-based agreements in the country.  The cryptocurrency market lost 0.2% in 24 hours to $2.12 trillion but saw a fresh drop in the US session during the day before rebounding on buying in lower volumes in Asian trading on Friday morning. The Sentiment Index fell to its lowest level in over a month at 32 (fear).

Title: Ripple CEO Seeks End to SEC Enforcement Actions Against Crypto
Date: October 11, 2024
Content:
[ccpw id="39382"] Date:  Written By:   Follow Us On Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expresses frustration over the SEC’s stringent crypto regulatory approach after the agency sued Cumberland for operating as an unregistered securities dealer.  In an X post yesterday, the Ripple CEO called the public’s attention to fresh comments from SEC commissioner Mark Uyeda, who criticized the agency’s approach to the crypto industry as a disaster.  Speaking in an interview on FOX Business, Uyeda said the SEC has been implementing its crypto policies through enforcement actions. However, the regulator has also failed to provide the industry with the needed guidance. He noted that while most crypto regulations are enacted through court verdicts, there have been different and inconsistent rulings.  “[There has been] broad frustrations with the fact that we [the SEC] have not provided guidance as to what you can and cannot do, and if you’re involved in some sort of securities offering, how you register as a broker-dealer, or as an exchange,” Uyeda remarked.  Commenting, Garlinghouse noted that people inside the SEC are also criticizing the commission’s crypto regulatory approach. He suggested that Uyeda’s commentary came at the same time the commission charged Cumberland with violating federal securities law.  “This circus needs to stop,” Garlinghouse echoed.  Yesterday, the SEC alleged that Cumberland operated as an unregistered securities dealer, violating federal registration requirements. It claimed that Cumberland sold $2 billion worth of crypto assets through third-party crypto exchanges since 2018.  Per the lawsuit, the SEC labeled five cryptos Cumberland handles as securities. They include Cardano (ADA), Algorand (ALGO), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and Filecoin (FIL).  Responding, Cumberland criticized the SEC, emphasizing that the regulator’s “enforcement-first approach” stifles innovation and prevents legitimate businesses from dealing in digital assets.  pic.twitter.com/xlz9ECFDYe — Cumberland (@CumberlandSays) October 10, 2024  The company mentioned the bi-partisan criticism of the SEC, with the House Financial Service Committee calling the commission a “rogue agency” for failing to work with Congress.  Cumberland revealed that it has taken several measures to comply with the SEC’s requirements, including acquiring a registered broker-dealer in 2019. Despite these efforts, the SEC limited the broker-dealer to trade only Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).  Notably, Cumberland said it will not change its business operations regardless of the SEC’s recent action.  The SEC’s latest action against Cumberland triggered reactions from top crypto stakeholders, including Justin Slaughter of Paradigm.  Reacting, Slaughter said it would be pleasing to see SEC Chair Gary Gensler reveal his hidden agenda against crypto. According to Slaughter, Gensler privately says he aims to destroy the crypto industry to protect traditional financial markets.  He suggested that Gensler is confident in betting on the SEC’s regulatory powers at the Supreme Court while singing Frank Loesser’s “Luck Be a Lady Tonight.”  Interestingly, Ripple’s CEO reacted to Slaughter’s comment with two loudspeaker emojis. Garlinghouse’s reaction is his way of calling people’s attention to Slaughter’s post, as he agrees with the perspective.  📣📣 https://t.co/f0vZ8NMHFL — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) October 10, 2024  Disclaimer: This content is informational and should not be considered financial advice.

Title: China's CBDC platform registers 180m wallets, 7.3t yuan in transactions
Date: October 11, 2024 at 11:13 am
Content:

Share  China’s CBDC app has reached a significant milestone with 180 million personal wallets and a staggering transaction volume of ¥7.3 trillion yuan in pilot regions. China‘s ambitious push for a central bank digital currency is gaining momentum, with millions embracing the new solution and changing the way money moves. Changchun Mu, the director-general of the digital currency institute at the People’s Bank of China, wrote in a column for Chinese media giant SINA that as of July, China’s CBDC — also known as the digital renminbi or e-CNY — has registered 180 million personal wallets opened and a total transaction volume of ¥7.3 trillion yuan ($1.02 trillion) across pilot regions. The PBoC has been proactive in developing the digital renminbi since 2014, engaging in extensive testing and piloting in cities like Shenzhen and Beijing. The e-CNY app, launched by the PBoC, has been instrumental in integrating digital currency into sectors like retail and public transport. Despite the rapid growth, adoption challenges remain. Sammy Lin, an account manager at a state-owned bank in Suzhou, earlier told local news media that many users, including herself, are hesitant to store funds in digital yuan wallets due to limited functionality and the lack of interest earnings. China’s efforts are part of a broader global trend, with 134 countries exploring CBDCs as of September, according to data from the Atlantic Council. This marks a sharp rise from 35 in 2020. For instance, 65 countries, including India, Brazil, and Australia, are in advanced stages of CBDC development, pilot testing, or launch. All G20 nations are also investigating digital currencies, with 19 in advanced phases.

Title: Top Crypto Price Predictions: Why Investors Are Leaning To Rollblock (RBLK) Over Dogecoin (DOGE) and Tron (TRX) - Brave New Coin
Date: Date not available
Content:
Q4 of the Bitcoin Halving and US election year is when the bull market really starts to gain pace. We’re seeing signs that the bull is back in charge now, so it’s a good time to look at some crypto price predictions. Legacy cryptos Dogecoin (DOGE) and Tron (TRX) have both performed well following the market bottoming out in the summer of 2022. Since then, DOGE is up about 30%, whereas the Tron price has surprised most by being up 3X. New crypto Rollblock has been capturing plenty of attention these last couple of months. It’s up over 200% while still in its presale, but best of all, there’s plenty of time to go. Analysts were onto Rollblock as soon as the presale was announced, and with gains of 100X predicted after it launches, it just might be the crypto to lead the bull charge in 2025. Rollblock’s presale is now entering stage 8 with over $4.1m raised, exceeding even the most bullish expectations. This momentum is a clear sign of the platform’s potential and reflects the trend of the bull market, especially for newer cryptos. As well as being an online casino, Rollblock token holders get to share in the profits generated by the platform’s online casino, and there are also staking rewards of up to 30% for those willing to stake and help with liquidity. Added with a buyback and burn mechanism, the scarcity of RBLK is guaranteed, and with it, there is a likely rise in value over time. Analysts have been bullish on Rollblock since the announcement of the platform, with crypto price predictions ranging from 880% during the presale up to 100x after it launches. It’s still early, but as with all bull markets, it’s the newest cryptos that offer the biggest ROI, and Rollblock looks set to lead the charge. Dogecoin is up about 30% since the market bottomed in Summer 2022, but for a meme coin, this growth is modest. Once fueled by Elon Musk endorsements, Dogecoin’s recent price action suggests waning enthusiasm, especially as the crypto market shifts toward projects with real utility. By the end of the bull market, DOGE should peak at $0.30. Tron has been one of the best-performing cryptos, with the Tron price up a whopping 3x since the market bottom. Much of this success is likely down to USDt transactions, but that could be coming to an end. The EU has clamped down on USDt, and crypto price predictions of $0.22 at the chart top mean the best is behind for the Tron price. Questions will remain about DOGE as investors continue to demand utility. This has been behind the Tron price’s surprise rise, but with USDT being outlawed by the EU, investors will be looking elsewhere. That is likely Rollblock, whose presale has been one of the most exciting corners of the crypto space during the bearish summer, but now the bull market is here, crypto price predictions of 100X is well within reach.

Title: SEC Charges Cumberland DRW as Unregistered Crypto Dealer - Markets Media
Date: Date not available
Content:
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Chicago-based Cumberland DRW LLC with operating as an unregistered dealer in more than $2 billion of crypto assets offered and sold as securities, in violation of the registration requirements of the federal securities laws that are designed to protect investors. According to the SEC’s complaint, since at least March 2018 through the present, Cumberland has acted as an unregistered dealer by buying and selling crypto assets offered and sold as securities for its own accounts as part of its regular business. As alleged in the complaint, Cumberland publicly calls itself “one of the world’s leading liquidity providers” in crypto assets and operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week by trading with counterparties by the telephone or through its online trading platform, Marea. The SEC’s complaint further alleges that Cumberland engages in trading crypto assets that are offered and sold as investment contracts on third-party crypto asset exchanges as part of its regular business. “The federal securities laws require all dealers in all securities to register with the Commission, and those who operate in the crypto asset markets are no exception,” said Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit (CACU). “Despite frequent protestations by the industry that sales of crypto assets are all akin to sales of commodities, our complaint alleges that Cumberland, the respective issuers, and objective investors treated the offer and sale of the crypto assets at issue in this case as investments in securities, and Cumberland profited from its dealer activity in these assets without providing investors and the market with the important protections afforded by registration.” The SEC’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charges Cumberland with violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Andrew McFall of the SEC’s Market Abuse Unit and Kathleen Hitchins of the CACU and supervised by Amy Flaherty Hartman, Paul Kim, and Mr. Tenreiro of the CACU. The SEC’s litigation will be led by Christopher Martin and Timothy Stockwell and supervised by Jack Kaufman and Mr. Tenreiro.

Title: $1.6 Billion Crypto Options Expiry Could Trigger Big Moves in Bitcoin & Ethereum  | Cryptoglobe
Date: Date not available
Content:
A total of $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin ($BTC) options are set to expire today, October 11, 2024, while an additional $510 million worth of Ethereum ($ETH) options contracts are to expire as well, injecting uncertainty into the cryptocurrency market that’s already set to deal with a $1.3 billion earthquake. With a combined notional value of nearly $1.6 billion, the expiry of these contracts, representing 18,000 BTC and 212,000 ETH, could trigger increased volatility in the coming days. According to analysts from Greeks.live, the put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin options contracts sits at 0.91, suggesting a bias towards put options, which give holders the right but not the obligation to sell BTC at a predetermined price. The analysts noted that the “maximum pain point” for Bitcoin, the price at which most options contracts would expire worthless, is at $62,000. Ethereum options, they wrote, have a put-to-call ratio of 0.4, with a “maximum pain point” at $2,450. 11 Oct Options Data18,000 BTC options are expiring with a Put Call Ratio of 0.91, Maxpain point of $62,000 and notional value of $1.1 billion.212,000 ETH options are about to expire with a Put Call Ratio of 0.4, Maxpain point of $2,450 and notional value of $510 million.With… pic.twitter.com/tWutpxCora Bitcoin is at the time of writing trading at around $61,000 per BTC after enduring a significant sell-off earlier this month that saw it drop from around $64,000 to a $60,000 low from which it is currently recovering. Etheruem, meanwhile, is at $2,400 after rising 1.7% over the past week amid the wider cryptocurrency market recovery. To the analysts at Greek.live a “market change could be just around the corner,” as Ethereum’s $2,300 support line and Bitcoin0’s $60,000 level have been contested numerous times. As CryptoGlobe reported, over  the past three days large Bitcoin holders, colloquially referred to as whales, have “sold or redistributed” around 30,000 BTC, the equivalent to more than $1.8 billion worth of the flagship cryptocurrency. The sell-off falls in line with a recent prediction that suggests Bitcoin coul soon  go “full bull” in a renewed rise that could see the cryptocurrency surpass the $80,000 mark, but before that occurs capitulation could be coming in a move that would take BTC below the $50,000 mark.

Try the first q: Uber just added a feature that lets riders opt for what? (Check your answer.) Undercover coins… The Department of Justice charged 18 people and companies following an FBI investigation into what authorities called a “wash trading” and “pump and dump” scheme. In an undercover op, the bureau created its own fake crypto biz along with a real ethereum-based token dubbed “NexfundAI.” The DOJ said three market makers — ZM Quant, CLS Global, and MyTrade — wash-traded (or conspired to wash-trade) the NexfundAI token on behalf of the FBI’s bogus biz. Spin cycle: Wash trading — trading an asset back and forth, often with bots and on a massive scale — is an illegal form of market manipulation. Not so clean: It’s been used to artificially inflate the price of coins and NFTs, generate trading rebates, and boost trading volume on exchanges. FBI fans: NexfundAI token-trading volume is said to have surged 5,000% after the DOJ revealed that the feds were behind it. Heavy duty… Wash trading’s long been a problem in crypto. A report said that in the three years up to September 2023, there was at least $2B in wash trading on ethereum decentralized exchanges. It’s not just an ETH problem: one researcher said a majority of July’s decentralized exchange volumes on solana may’ve been inorganic (think: bots, wash trading). Crypto’s still in cleanup mode… Since FTX, the industry’s worked to shed its shady rep. DOJ charges of market manipulation for hire don’t help.

Sales at the world’s largest furniture retailer this year fell 5% to $49B — its first revenue drop since 2020 — after it slashed prices on thousands of items by an average of 10%. Ikea said the sales dip could hurt its profit, which it’ll report next month. And though the dollar value of sales was down, transactions were up: Meatballin’: Ikea execs said discounting drove 21% more visits to its stores and website and boosted the # of items it sold by 7%. The company also slung 1.2B meatballs on the year, making it one of the world’s biggest restaurant chains. Big bag: Before its discounting wave, Ikea had assembled huge price bumps on some of its products. The cost of a loveseat rose 66% between 2021 and the end of 2022, while a dining-table-and-chairs set (shout out, Jokkmokk) surged 80%. Not just Ikea… A wave of retailer discounting appears to be boosting demand. Target, which slashed prices on thousands of items this summer, said its comparable sales last quarter rose for the first time in a year. Walmart, which has discounted 7K+ items, reported 5% quarterly revenue growth. JCPenney yanked prices down last year and saw store traffic more than double. And Costco said that lowering the price of its Kirkland chicken led to a 21% sales bump. Disinflation = motivation… Price control is big, especially for retailers known for value like Ikea and Walmart. Price cuts help keep them competitive and spur renewed demand. Other companies have prolonged their promotions after seeing customers return: last month McDonald's said it would be extending its $5-meal deal.

Title: SEC charges Cumberland for unregistered crypto dealing - AMBCrypto
Date: October 11, 2024
Content:
The SEC is at it again with its latest enforcement action!  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged crypto market maker Cumberland with operating as an unregistered dealer.  SEC alleged that the company has been buying and selling crypto assets without proper registration since March 2018. According to the SEC, Cumberland has ignored regulatory requirements despite calls from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler urging cryptocurrency firms to “come in and register.”  The regulatory body claims that Cumberland was explicitly prohibited from using its registered broker-dealer status for crypto activities, which has now been dormant, but continued to operate in the crypto space nonetheless.  The SEC’s action against Cumberland is part of its broader efforts to tighten regulatory control over the U.S. crypto market. It has been scrutinizing crypto firms for compliance with securities laws, with a particular focus on companies that operate without the necessary registrations.  Cumberland’s case emphasizes the SEC’s stance on crypto market makers who operate outside regulatory frameworks, underscoring the agency’s commitment to bringing these entities under its jurisdiction. The SEC’s charges against Cumberland come amid a wave of regulatory actions targeting the crypto industry. In recent months, the SEC has taken significant steps to clamp down on unregistered activities within the sector.  Earlier this year, the agency charged crypto exchange Bittrex for allegedly failing to register as a broker, clearing agency, and exchange.  In a similar move, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, claiming that it was operating as an unregistered broker and exchange, with Gensler emphasizing the need for all cryptocurrency entities engaging in securities-related activities to adhere to registration requirements. These actions are part of a wider strategy by the SEC to assert regulatory control over the cryptocurrency market in the U.S. The agency’s approach has raised concerns within the crypto community, with many industry leaders arguing that the SEC’s enforcement-heavy stance stifles innovation and drives crypto businesses overseas. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 However, the SEC maintains that its actions are necessary to protect investors and ensure that crypto assets are subject to the same rules as traditional financial products.      Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Trust Wallet Review 2024: Is Trust Wallet Safe? – Cryptocurrency News & Trading Tips – Crypto Blog by Changelly
Date: Date not available
Content:
Scan QR code to download the app. Table of Contents Blog › Academy › Trust Wallet Review 2024: Is Trust Wallet Safe? Trust Wallet has become a popular choice for cryptocurrency investors looking for a secure and user-friendly way to store their digital assets.  However, with the rise of scams and security breaches in the crypto space, many are left wondering: Is Trust Wallet really safe? In this article, we will explore the security features of Trust Wallet and provide tips on how to keep your funds secure while using the platform. Table of Contents Overall, Trust Wallet offers a secure and user-friendly option for managing a diverse range of digital assets. Yes, Trust Wallet is recognized for its robust security, thanks to features like non-custodial access, open-source technology, and biometric authentication. However, users must complement these with strong security practices to mitigate risks, especially from phishing attacks, which remain a significant threat in the crypto space. Make sure to download Trust Wallet from official sources and maintain vigilant password management and recovery phrase protection. Additionally, verifying communications and updates through the official Trust Wallet website is crucial for safeguarding your Trust Wallet account against phishing schemes. Remember, the security of your wallet also depends on the safety of your device and network, so keeping them secure is essential for overall wallet security. Having focused their efforts on users’ peace of mind, Trust Wallet has implemented various measures to protect against unauthorized access and potential threats. Let’s take a closer look at those security measures to understand how they keep users’ digital assets safe and secure. For starters, Trust Wallet offers an extra layer of security for its users by requiring a PIN or password to access the application. To set up a PIN for the mobile app, users can navigate to the settings menu and select Security. From there, they can choose to enable the PIN feature and set a unique 4-6 digit PIN. In the Chrome browser extension, users can set up a password by going to the settings and selecting the Security tab. Setting up a strong PIN or password for Trust Wallet enhances its security by preventing unauthorized access to user digital assets. So, users can feel at peace knowing that even if their devices fall into the wrong hands, their funds and personal information are protected. At its core, Trust Wallet is a non-custodial storage solution that gives users full control over their private keys. This means that users retain ownership and control of their funds, unlike with custodial wallets where a third party holds the private keys. With Trust Wallet, users can enjoy the benefits of anonymity and extra security. No registration required! Non-custodial storage is significant in promoting privacy and security as it ensures that users are the sole custodians of their funds and personal information. With Trust Wallet, users can rest assured that their assets are secure and private because no personal information is required to use the wallet. The concept of non-custodial storage has a significant impact on user experience: it allows for a seamless and secure way to manage digital assets without the need for third-party intervention. The 12-word recovery phrase is a crucial component in recovering wallets and accessing cryptocurrency funds. It serves as a backup that allows users to regain access to their wallets in case the original wallet is lost or damaged. It is imperative to emphasize the importance of keeping the seed phrase private and never sharing it with anyone. Sharing the seed phrase with others can compromise the security of your digital assets and expose you to potential theft. Best practices for storing and protecting your 12-word seed phrase involve physical storage methods rather than digital. This is crucial in preventing hacking and data breaches. Consider using a fireproof and waterproof container to store your seed phrase safely. The short answer is no. But, in addressing this question, it’s essential to consider two separate incidents that raised concerns about Trust Wallet’s security. Firstly, in November 2022, Trust Wallet identified a security vulnerability that led to a loss of nearly $170,000 for some users. This issue, linked to the Wallet Core open-source library and its WebAssembly component specifically, affected new wallet addresses generated between November 14 and 23, 2022. Trust Wallet took swift action upon discovering this through their bug bounty program in April 2023, patching the vulnerability and initiating a reimbursement process for the affected users, including covering $7,700 in gas fees for fund transfers to new, secure wallets. Secondly, in February 2023, a high-profile case involved a Trust Wallet user losing $4 million due to a social engineering scam by a criminal organization in Rome, Italy. This incident was not a direct hack of Trust Wallet’s infrastructure but a targeted attack where criminals exploited human trust. Trust Wallet’s investigation concluded that the theft was executed through a sophisticated social engineering scheme, not a direct vulnerability in Trust Wallet’s system. In conclusion, while Trust Wallet itself has not been directly hacked through its infrastructure or codebase, these incidents underscore the importance of vigilance against social engineering tactics and the necessity of promptly addressing software vulnerabilities. Trust Wallet has demonstrated a commitment to security, maintaining a relatively clean record against direct hacks. Read also: Best crypto wallets for 2024. From its multi-currency support to its robust security measures, Trust Wallet offers a comprehensive solution for managing digital assets on the go. In this part of the article, we will explore some of the key features that make Trust Wallet stand out in the crowded crypto wallet market.  Trust Wallet offers users the opportunity to stake their cryptocurrencies and earn rewards through staking. This feature allows users to earn interest from their crypto holdings and participate in governing currency networks. Currently, Trust Wallet supports staking of 23 cryptocurrencies, including Tron (TRX), Tezos (XTZ), Cosmos (ATOM), Kava (KAVA), Solana (SOL), Terra Classic (LUNA), Binance Coin (BNB), and Cardano (ADA). The staking process involves locking coins into a wallet for a specified period in exchange for rewards. This allows users to actively contribute to the functioning of the supported currency networks while earning additional coins in the form of staking rewards. Trust Wallet offers comprehensive support for NFTs (non-fungible tokens), allowing users to view, store, and transfer their digital collectibles with ease. Since the NFT storage and gallery feature in Trust Wallet supports various token standards such as ERC721, ERC1155, BEP721, and BEP1155 on both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), users can actually manage their NFT collections seamlessly across multiple blockchains. Trust Wallet provides access to a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) for crypto enthusiasts. Users can explore popular dApps such as Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Curve, 1inch, and OpenSea directly from their Trust Wallet app. Uniswap and PancakeSwap, for example, are popular choices for token swapping, allowing users to trade between different cryptocurrencies. Curve is a great tool for stablecoin and token swapping, while OpenSea is the go-to marketplace for NFT enthusiasts. Trust Wallet’s integration with these dApps enhances the overall user experience, offering users more opportunities for managing and growing their crypto portfolios. Whether you’re a casual investor, trader, or DeFi enthusiast, Trust Wallet’s dApps provide a versatile platform for accessing the world of decentralized finance. Trust Wallet offers a convenient feature that allows users to make crypto purchases directly within the app using various payment methods, including credit or debit cards. One of the benefits of buying crypto in Trust Wallet is that there are no wallet fees. However, it’s important to note that blockchain network fees for transactions are still there and vary depending on the cryptocurrency and network congestion. Are you considering managing your digital assets with Trust Wallet? Let’s dive into their fee policy to understand better what to expect. Trust Wallet is free, which means that you can download or install Trust Wallet at no cost. There are no storage fees associated with using Trust Wallet, so users don’t have to worry about extra charges when holding and managing their digital assets. This makes Trust Wallet a cost-effective solution for individuals looking to securely store their various crypto assets. With no hidden costs or ongoing fees, Trust Wallet provides a reliable and economical storage option for crypto enthusiasts. Trust Wallet’s policy of not charging any fees for receiving funds makes it an attractive option for users looking to easily and cost-effectively manage their cryptocurrency holdings. This feature allows users to freely receive funds from other wallets without worrying about any additional costs or deductions. However, when it comes to transferring funds from Trust Wallet to another user, users should be aware of gas fees. These fees are necessary as cryptocurrency transactions require computational resources to execute, and the gas fees help cover the network costs associated with processing these transactions. Trust Wallet users must understand that the gas fees incurred during transfers are not a source of revenue for Trust Wallet. They are utilized to pay the respective network for transaction processing. The wallet provides users with information about the tentative network fee before proceeding with a transfer, giving them transparency and control over their transaction costs. While these fees may be unavoidable when using Trust Wallet, users may be somewhat reassured that these funds support the network infrastructure.  Trust Wallet offers a convenient and cost-effective way for users to swap tokens within their wallet interface without incurring any additional fees. This is a significant advantage for users who want to easily manage and exchange different cryptocurrencies without having to worry about extra costs eating into their profits. While there is an exchange rate that needs to be considered when swapping tokens, Trust Wallet ensures that users are informed of these rates so they can make a well-informed decision. Trust Wallet facilitates the purchase of cryptocurrencies via credit or debit cards using services from third-party processors like Simplex and MoonPay. Although Trust Wallet itself imposes no transaction fees, these external processors have a service charge. Typically, Simplex’s fees range from 3.5% to 5% for credit/debit card transactions, which might be considered steep compared to standard transaction fees. It’s advisable for users to familiarize themselves with these charges to prevent any unexpected costs on their bank statements. When buying crypto directly through the Trust Wallet app, users encounter an extra 1% fee added to the charges levied by third-party exchanges. However, there’s a way to bypass this extra fee. By owning at least 100 Trust Wallet tokens ($TWT), this additional charge is waived. $TWT tokens are available in various forms, including TWT BEP2, TWT BEP20, or TWT SPL. Holding these tokens exempts you from the extra fee associated with purchasing cryptocurrencies. Despite Trust Wallet’s strong customer satisfaction and high ratings on the Apple App Store (4.7/5 from over 190,000 reviews) and Google Play Store (4.6/5 from more than 1.3 million reviews), its customer support struggles to match this excellence, as evidenced by a low 1.3/5-star rating on TrustPilot, with 88% of reviewers rating it the lowest possible score. Trust Wallet lacks traditional customer service options like a contact number. For support, the best resource is the Trust Wallet community forum, where users can find comprehensive assistance, including announcements and responses from the Trust Wallet support team. For more specific issues, submitting an online ticket is advised.  Trust Wallet, as a prominent mobile cryptocurrency wallet, offers a range of features designed to facilitate the secure management of digital assets. Like any platform, it has its strengths and weaknesses. Here’s an overview of the pros and cons associated with using Trust Wallet: Trust Wallet is best recognized as an excellent choice for users seeking a reliable wallet that seamlessly bridges the gap between the convenience of a hot wallet and the interactive capabilities of a Web3 wallet. With its built-in Web3 browser, Trust Wallet offers millions of users direct access to decentralized applications, making it an indispensable tool for those deeply embedded in the DeFi and NFT ecosystems. Its support of a wide range of tokens and user-friendly interface cater to beginners and seasoned crypto enthusiasts alike. The platform’s non-custodial nature ensures that users retain full control over their private keys, providing a level of security and autonomy that is highly valued in the digital asset space. For individuals prioritizing ease of use, quick access to a broad spectrum of digital assets, and direct interaction with the decentralized web, Trust Wallet stands out as the software wallet of choice. However, where Trust Wallet falls short is in its inherent limitations as a hot wallet and a software wallet, particularly for users seeking the utmost security for their digital assets. Unlike hardware wallets or cold storage solutions, which store private keys offline and are less susceptible to online hacking attempts, Trust Wallet, being a mobile application, cannot offer the same level of security. This makes it less ideal for storing large amounts of cryptocurrencies or for users who prioritize security above all else. Additionally, while Trust Wallet’s versatility as a Web3 wallet is commendable, the absence of a built-in exchange feature and the reliance on third-party services for certain transactions can introduce complexity and inconvenience for some users. For those requiring the enhanced security features of cold wallets or the comprehensive functionality of hardware wallets, Trust Wallet might not fully meet their needs. Trust Wallet was created by Viktor Radchenko in 2017. He developed the wallet initially as a user-friendly option for people looking to store Ethereum and Ethereum-based tokens. As of 2024, Trust Wallet is owned by Binance. Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, acquired Trust Wallet in July 2018. Both platforms employ high security standards, but the nature of risk is different. Trust Wallet is a decentralized wallet where you maintain full control over your private keys, which are stored on your device. This approach generally offers a higher level of security against centralized breaches or exchange hacks, as your keys are not held on a server that could be targeted. Binance Wallet, as part of the centralized Binance exchange, manages your keys and funds. While Binance employs robust security measures, the centralized nature means that it could be more susceptible to large-scale security breaches. Summing up, Trust Wallet might be considered safer if you prioritize having direct control over your private keys and reducing the risk of centralized hacks. Binance Wallet, however, provides the convenience and quick access to trading services, with its security strength backed by the extensive measures of a major exchange.

Title: Top Crypto Stories This Week: From FBI Stings to Misidentifying Satoshi
Date: 

      11 October 2024


       . 6:24 PM

Even the FBI is playing make-believe in the mysterious world of crypto, which is still struggling to uncover the true identity of Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto Crypto has established a notorious reputation as the seedy underbelly of finance. Understanding the industry often requires digging deep into the rabbit hole, uncovering mysteries and oddities along the way. For investigators and journalists alike, story opportunities are rife but more than often, answers to questions incur even more questions. The true identity of Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto is the industry's biggest enigma. HBO director, Cullen Hobak, was the latest brave soul to take a stab at solving the puzzle once and for all. Famed for correctly identifying the person behind the QAnon conspiracy theory in his previous HBO documentary, Q: Into The Storm, Hobak had the industry on a knife edge, waiting for his latest documentary to drop. Len Sassaman and Nick Szabo were pundits' picks for Nakamoto's identity ahead of the documentary's release. However, when Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery eventually dropped midweek, viewers were disappointed to learn that Hobak's money seemed to be on Pete Todd, who wasn't even among the names on Polymarket's list of candidates. Seasoned industry participants have long dismissed Todd as the person behind Nakamoto, and despite Hobak's best efforts, the mystery remains unsolved. A more successful form of investigatory crypto work came in the guise of the FBI. In a plot that seemed lifted straight from The Blacklist, the FBI went undercover and infiltrated the crypto industry. Posing as a token lister, the FBI had secret meetings with market makers who generously offered to artificially pump the price of their tokens. The FBI's hard work resulted in eighteen individuals facing criminal charges from the Department of Justice. It seems you simply can't trust anyone in the crypto industry, which might be a bit too much for millennials. Instead of diving into the deep end of staking, memecoins, and DeFi option vaults, millennials are reportedly hot for crypto ETFs. A study by Schwab Asset Management titled "ETFs and Beyond" has found that around 62% of millennials plan to invest in crypto ETFs over the next year. Although this is higher than alternative ETFs (25%), fixed-income ETFs (47%) and smart beta ETFs (29%), it does suggest that the demographic might be less risk-averse than pure crypto investors.  Compared to the traditional 60/40 portfolio split, millennials are allocating 54% of their portfolios to equities and 46% to fixed income - a much less risky balance. It does, nonetheless, prove that crypto ETFs are sexier than traditional ETFs - not that anyone thought otherwise. Meanwhile, in the markets, both Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced downward pressure throughout the week but managed to recover over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin ended the week around 0.5% higher while Ethereum scraped by at 0.1% higher. Risk appetites have intensified from last week's 41, "Fear," to 32, also "Fear." The Fear & Greed Index uses 5-6 measurements to assess the current sentiment of the market and then rates that level of emotion on a scale of 1-100 – 1 is extreme fear and 100 is extreme greed. But as always, fear not, because BRN analyst, Valentin Fournier, has you covered. This week, he maintains his recommendation for heavy exposure to Bitcoin, anticipating a strong rally as the year comes to a close. "In the face of substantial selling pressure and escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, Bitcoin continues to hold strong," he explains.  "Several bullish factors point toward optimism in the coming weeks: global interest rates are on the decline, China has launched a significant economic stimulus, the U.S. economy remains robust, unemployment is falling, and the upcoming U.S. presidential election could serve as a catalyst for risky assets." Both headline #CPI (0.2% vs. 0.1% expected) and core CPI (0.3% vs. 0.2% expected) exceeded expectations, triggering a quick market reaction. $BTC fell back to its $59,000 support level in response.  (1/8) Cryptocurrency can now be divided between married couples in South Korea during divorce proceedings. South Korean law firm IPG Legal clarified the law, stating that both tangible and intangible assets, including crypto, can be divided during a divorce. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a lawsuit against Cumberland DRW, a prominent crypto market maker, alleging that the company acted as an unregistered securities dealer by promoting and trading $2 billion in crypto assets that should have been registered as securities. Virtual assets and investment fund management are no longer subject to value-added tax, according to an updated version of the Executive Regulation of Federal Decree Law released on October 2 by the UAE Federal Tax Authority (FTA). The adjustments made in response to a Cabinet decision are effective November 15 this year. WisdomTree has introduced a new feature that allows users to access its tokenised fund via their debit card. According to an announcement, users can select the WisdomTree Government Money Market Digital Fund (WTGXX) as a source of funds for their WisdomTree Prime Visa debit card. Global investment management firm VanEck has announced the launch of a $30 million early-stage venture capital fund dedicated to supporting innovative startups in the fintech, digital assets, and artificial intelligence sectors. The VanEck Ventures fund will focus on pre-seed and seed-stage companies, providing them with the capital and expertise needed to scale their businesses, according to an announcement on Wednesday Hong Kong’s financial regulator, the Securities Futures Commission (SFC), has revealed that it plans to issue more licenses to crypto exchanges and digital asset firms by the end of the year. According to local media outlet HK01, SFC CEO Julia Leung said the regulator aims to “make progress” in approving licenses for eleven Virtual Asset Trading Platforms (VATPs). The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has created its own cryptocurrency token to trap suspects in fraud schemes. NexFundAI, which operated on the Ethereum blockchain, was created by the bureau to catch illicit market makers and manipulators. The token was presented as an opportunity to invest in early-stage artificial intelligence (AI) projects. Despite China's stock market's meteoric rise following the country's enormous stimulus, many international analysts and investment managers still need to be convinced. Its sharp decline over the past few days hasn't helped matters either. Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) is set to launch a pilot program for virtual asset custody services in early 2025, local media outlet Central News Agency reported this week. The pilot program comes as part of the FSC's broader efforts to foster innovation in the financial sector while ensuring consumer protection and market integrity. The regulator has been working on a dedicated special law for the virtual asset industry, which is expected to be finalized by the end of this year. Crypto.com has filed a lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just over a month after receiving a formal warning from the regulator In a statement, the crypto exchange said it is suing the SEC to "protect the future of the crypto industry in the US" following the receipt of a Wells Notice on 22 August. The mystery of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's identity has long plagued the crypto industry but more than a decade later, the truth is still beyond reach. HBO is the latest to take a stab at identifying the pseudonymous crypto OG. In its new documentary, Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery, HBO suggests that Canadian software developer Peter Todd might be the man behind Nakamoto. With the approval of rules for their use by a consortium of financial institutions, efforts to enable tokenised shares of money-market funds from Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton as collateral in trading took a significant step ahead. After strong US data cast doubt on bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates significantly next month, stocks dropped, and benchmark Treasury bond rates climbed back over 4%. The market's see-saw is likely to continue, driven by traders taking opposing positions on the news between large Fed rate cut bets and the resilience of the US economy. Tokens like USDT, created by Tether Holdings, will likely suffer when Coinbase Global delists all unauthorised stablecoins from its EU crypto exchange before the end of the year. By year's end, the European Union will have completely implemented MiCA, new regulations to regulate the cryptocurrency business. FTX has received approval from a US court for its bankruptcy plan to repay customers. The ruling will allow the fallen cryptocurrency exchange to use the $16.5 billion it managed to recover. US Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey praised FTX's plan as a "model case for how to deal with a very complex Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding." Hong Kong Virtual Asset Exchange (HKVAX) has officially received Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 7 (providing automated trading services) licenses from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), alongside the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO) license, the exchange announced in a statement. On this week’s Blockcast, we speak with Luca Prosperi, co-founder and CEO at M^0 Labs, whose man-bun and genial personality belies battle scars from almost 2 decades of traditional banking, helping to build MakerDAO and, a health scare. Luca dissects the concept of money creation and some of the foundations behind M^0’s quest to build infrastructure for a crypto dollar.

Title: Tron Founder Justin Sun Appointed 'Prime Minister' Of A Crypto-Focused Micronation In Europe  - Benzinga
Date: Date not available
Content:
Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron TRX/USD network, has been elected as the Prime Minister of Liberland, a so-called micronation with an economy built around cryptocurrencies and blockchains. What Happened: Sun was nominated by President Vít Jedlička to serve as the acting PM after the cryptocurrency entrepreneur was declared the winner of a blockchain-based election process. Sun’s accomplishments in space were recognized by the president’s office, and the administration hoped that the region’s blockchain initiatives would get a boost under him. See Also: Trump Widens Lead Over Harris In Betting Odds On Prediction Markets —Sets A New High On Crypto-Based Polymarket Sandwiched between Croatia and Serbia on the west bank of the Danube River, Liberland was founded by Czech politician Jedlička, who now serves as the president. Though Liberland says that the 7 km² space it occupies hasn’t been claimed by either of the two countries, Croatia has deemed it a “fictitious project” and contrary to international law.  As of this writing, there has been no diplomatic recognition of Liberland by any member nation-state of the United Nations. A so-called libertarian utopia, the region’s entire governance and legislation is managed on-chain, while the Liberland dollar (LLD) acts as the operational token of the blockchain. The recent elections were conducted using a blockchain-based system, which, according to Liberland, ensures transparency and removes any doubts about election results. The micronation aims to set an example for other countries still using traditional election methods. Why It Matters: Justin Sun’s election as Prime Minister of Liberland comes after a significant setback in his career. In April last year, Sun lost his role as the Ambassador of Grenada to the World Trade Organization (WTO) following an SEC lawsuit against him. He has served in this role since November 2021 and led Grenada’s delegation at the 12th Ministerial Conference. Interestingly. he continues to use the initials H.E. (“His Excellency”) before his name on his official X account.  Price Action: At the time of writing, TRX, Tron’s native currency was trading at $0.1587, broadly unchanged in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.   Photo Courtesy: Wikimedia Commons Read Next:   © 2024 Benzinga.com.

Title: South Korea and regulation: has the ban on crypto ETFs been abolished?
Date: 11 October 2024
Content:
Twist in South Korea, where the new financial regulatory committee dedicated to cryptocurrencies might abolish the current ban on spot crypto ETFs.  Summary In South Korea there might be a change of scenario regarding the current ban on spot crypto ETFs. The new crypto committee of the FSC, the country’s financial regulatory authority, is considering what to do.  According to what reported, it seems that the new committee for cryptocurrencies, a recently formed advisory group to discuss policies on digital assets, will review the current ban. This softer approach compared to the rigidity of the past,  comes after  the legislators requested a change.  In fact, the FSC had reiterated its strict stance on not wanting to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs last January, when instead they were given the green light in the USA. This position was meant to convey the message of absolutely not wanting to follow in the footsteps of the United States. Until today, in South Korea, local financial institutions are prohibited from owning and purchasing crypto. Not only that, it is also forbidden to invest in companies that offer cryptocurrencies.  As a result, the country has always remained firm on the idea that it was prohibited to issue and launch ETFs on Bitcoin and on Spot crypto.  Yet, today something is changing. From what has emerged, in fact, it seems that the different parties have promised the approval of local bitcoin ETFs in their general election campaigns, right at the beginning of this year. Already last April, after the victory of the democratic party in South Korea there was talk of preparation for what would be the abolition of the ban on spot crypto ETFs. At that moment, it was said that such an introduction would mean a historic moment for the country but also for the entire crypto market in Asia.  In fact, this move would represent a wider acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into the country’s rigid financial system.  Today, with the establishment of the new internal committee of the FSC, dedicated solely to cryptocurrencies, the promise of the election campaign might perhaps become a reality.  Remaining in the context of crypto regulation in South Korea, last June new guidelines were established involving Non-Fungible Tokens.  In fact, it seems that some NFTs will be treated like regular crypto, introducing a regulatory framework intended to govern the growing market of mass-produced NFTs.  In practice, the new guidelines of the FSC will be applied to NFTs produced in series that will be traded like normal crypto. Specifically, the trading of such NFTs must comply with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and KYC requirements, in order to prevent the misuse of these digital assets.  Series-produced NFTs are all NFTs created in large quantities and intended for frequent exchange.  Stay updated on all the news about cryptocurrencies and the entire world of blockchain.

Title: Crypto Edges Towards Mass Adoption With SEC Approval Of Options For BTC ETFs
Date: Oct 9, 2024,
Content:
Crypto Bitcoin Approval  - ETF -US. SEC - Photo Illustration 2024 has been the year of improving trust and investor confidence in crypto with the SEC approval and launch of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) for spot bitcoin (BTC) followed by ether (ETH). The AUM for spot BTC ETFs has the crossed the $50 billion mark in less than a year as both retail and institutional investors adopted this instrument for exposure to crypto. According to data from CoinGlass, spot BTC ETFs have delivered mostly positive net inflows since their launch. Total Bitcoin Spot ETF Net Inflow (USD)  Unique Divine, ceo of Nibiru, says, “The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in January ended a decade-long wait. Billions in institutional inflows followed. This was only the beginning." Because bitcoin is a volatile asset, and regulatory concerns remain, several TradFi players, especially smaller ones, do not deal directly in spot ETFs. This is one of the remaining barriers to crypto and spot ETFs achieving critical mass. The SEC's approval of Options on spot BTC ETFs is a key positive development towards fostering greater adoption, though arguably not as accelerated as the SEC claimed in its filing on September 20. In the SEC’s view, the move will, “help investors to hedge their positions and manage crypto-related risk.” When BTC ETF Options go live following the CFTC and OCC approvals, it will be the first regulated leverage tool for one of the world’s most decentralized and supply-constrained commodities. Though bitcoin’s non-custodial, deflationary store of value narrative has gained considerable strength over the years, it has so far been unable to capitalize on the liquidity boost that synthetic leverage enables. Institutions have mostly remained on the sidelines given excessive counterparty risks and lack of redress mechanisms. Retail investors have to rely heavily on inefficient, perpetual or "perps" based instruments for leverage. As Rich Rines, Core DAO contributor, highlights, "Following the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, the traditional financial world has been searching for more flexible ways to engage with bitcoin. "Options are one of the first ways traditional institutions can increase exposure, manage risks, and generate income with Bitcoin. Once institutions can earn yield via Bitcoin ETFs, options will be an invaluable tool in the toolbelt for sophisticated traditional institutions." The prospect of securing longer-term incentives for stakeholders to move beyond speculation with mote sophisticated hedging tools is one of the biggest anticipated benefits of the Options approval. Adds Nibiru, " With each step forward, momentum is built, driving the SEC’s approval of Ethereum ETFs in July. Now, we’re on the cusp of a new era. Digital assets, once fringe, are evolving into regulated investment vehicles. Accessible. Mainstream. For everyone.” Spot BTC ETF Options might be the first, but they surely won’t be the last. ETH ETFs, and possibly even SOL or other altcoin ETFs in the future, will inevitably get Options-based instruments in some capacity sooner or later. Against this backdrop, the approval of BTC ETF Options will further contribute to the virtuous feedback loop where more trust brings more liquidity into the space, which further improves trust and demand for a wide range of secondary products. Abhitej Singh, founder of Filament Finance, notes, “Given their time aspect, among other factors, Options provide a solid foundation for all kinds of financial derivatives, which can be a massive value unlock in the context of DeFi. "With products like defined-outcome ETFs, premium income funds, tail risk ETFs, etc., bitcoin holders will now get loads of opportunities to use their bitcoin to generate value without selling them." Generating passive or low-risk income of BTC is an important factor in boosting the asset’s utilization ratio, which is currently as low as 0.2 percent according to Grayscale. The launch of Options will help catalyze the move that spot ETFs have already started. It represents a trillion-dollar opportunity, but more importantly, strengthening bitcoin’s value proposition will inevitably improve crypto’s value proposition through greater competition, the trickle-down effect, and market rotation. Alongside other bullish macro-economic and regulatory developments like the Fed’s much-awaited rate cut signaling the easing cycle and the Bank of New York's market entry as a bitcoin custodian for ETF providers, the approval of Options on spot ETFs marks another milestone for crypto’s journey to mass retail. While this is likely to produce net positive results, it’s also helps to ensure that crypto’s foundational values and principles remain intact in the face of increasing institutional participation. Shibtoshi, founder of SilentSwap, says, “Institutional participation and political attention are welcome from a business and growth standpoint, but now is also the time to hold crypto’s core vision in high regard. The goal is to build decentralized, community-oriented tools with institution-level security and stability. Otherwise, it won’t be long before crypto’s fate becomes the same as Web2’s.” Adds Paxful ceo, Roshan Dharia, “Publicly traded bitcoin options are a vital tool for the maturing cryptocurrency market, offering both hedging opportunities and greater price discovery. "We see these instruments as part of a larger ecosystem that enhances liquidity and provides institutional and retail investors alike more sophisticated strategies for managing risk. We believe these advancements ultimately strengthen the market, making crypto a more attractive, stable, and robust asset class globally.” For the BTC or crypto-backed financial ecosystem to realize its potential, it’s important not to lose sight of the broader mission amidst this period of institutional validation and greater retail adoption. The endgame is a more holistic financial ecosystem for investors to easily access the benefits of the decentralization of finance, and new opportunities for yield, with the convenience, seamlessness, and protections offered in many of today's regulated financial markets. Spot BTC ETF Options offer another instrument to move the industry forward in this direction. Whether they will, remains to be seen.  One Community.

Title: Crypto VC fund-tied entity loses $36m by signing phishing permit transaction: report
Date: October 11, 2024 at 7:42 am
Content:

Share  An entity reportedly linked to a cryptocurrency venture capital fund has lost over $35 million in tokens due to a malicious permit transaction. An unidentified on-chain entity has suffered a staggering loss of wrapped Ethereum (ETH) tokens valued at $36 million after inadvertently signing a malicious transaction. Crazy!Someone(probably related to @ContinueFund) lost 15,079 fwDETH(worth $36M) by signing a "permit" phishing signature 6 hours ago!To avoid being phished, please do not click on any unknown links and do not sign any unknown signatures.Always double-check when signing… pic.twitter.com/dTG4Uzsf43 In an X post on Friday, Oct. 11, blockchain monitoring account Lookonchain reported that the entity, believed to be associated with the crypto venture capital fund Continue Capital, lost 15,079 fwDETH — wrapped ETH tokens on Blast’s chain — due to a “permit” phishing signature. As of press time, Continue Capital made no public statements on the matter. TL;DR: An unknown suspicious address obtained tens of thousands of fwdETH through the permit method and sold them, causing the price of dETH to plummet rapidly, leading to attacks on protocols like PAC Finance and Orbit Finance.https://t.co/FwsGhSfs0q@RingProtocol… Following the news, the price of fwDETH plummeted by more than 95% in its trading pair with fwWETH before rebounding to a 40% decline. An X user under the alias @roffett_eth pointed out that the price drop led to “attacks on protocols like PAC Finance and Orbit Finance,” though the extent of these attacks remains unclear. Neither project has commented on the situation as of this writing. Phishing attacks in the cryptocurrency sector are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often disguised as legitimate requests for user permissions. In this case, the victim appears to have fallen victim to a tactic that exploits user trust in digital signatures, underscoring the persistent risks within the crypto landscape.

A Comprehensive Review  Coinbase Wallet is a popular digital wallet that enables users to securely store and manage their digital assets. It is owned and operated by Coinbase, a centralized cryptocurrency exchange based in San Francisco. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at Coinbase Wallet’s features, security, and user experience to help you decide if it’s the right wallet for you. We’ll also discuss some pros and cons of using Coinbase Wallet to help you make an informed decision. Hi! I’m Zifa, your dedicated guide to the expansive world of cryptocurrency. With an unwavering passion for all things crypto, I’ve spent years immersing myself in this dynamic field, deciphering its complexities and trends. But what truly sets me apart? I believe it’s my knack for distilling difficult concepts into simple language. Consider it my superpower — transforming intricate blockchain labyrinths into digestible pathways of understanding. Join me as we explore the crypto cosmos together, one blog post at a time. I’m thrilled to have you on board! Table of Contents Coinbase Wallet is a non-custodial mobile and browser extension digital wallet that lets users securely store and manage their cryptocurrencies and NFTs. It serves as a bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies, delivering an intuitive interface for users to access their digital assets anywhere. Coinbase.com is one of the most popular cryptocurrency brokerage platforms in the market today. It allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies easily and facilitates instant exchanges. The main difference between Coinbase.com and Coinbase Wallet is the way it stores its crypto assets. On Coinbase.com, store crypto assets are stored on their online exchange; however, these crypto assets are out of user control, which makes them vulnerable to external hacking or attacks. On the other hand, Coinbase Wallet offers a more secure way to store your crypto holdings in a self-custody wallet. This means users can retain full control over their funds as they will be stored in an individual, personally owned wallet instead of on an exchange or broker site like Coinbase. Furthermore, many features make this wallet convenient and user-friendly — think of allowing people to make payments with just one tap using their phone’s contact list, along with supporting over 100 different coins and tokens, including Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and more.  A self-custody wallet, also known as a non-custodial wallet, is a type of digital wallet where the user has full control over the private keys associated with their cryptocurrency. This stands in contrast to custodial wallets, where a third party, like a cryptocurrency exchange or a bank, holds the private keys. In a self-custody wallet, you are solely responsible for managing your private keys, which also means you have complete control over your cryptocurrency assets. The wallet will generate a cryptographic pair of keys — a public key, which is your wallet address, and a private key, which is used to sign transactions. When you initially configure your Coinbase Wallet for your Coinbase account, it creates a recovery phrase, often called a “seed phrase.” This phrase, consisting of 12 simple words, acts as the master password to your wallet, ensuring access to all your cryptocurrencies and NFTs as long as you remember it. Self-custody wallets can be either software-based, installed on your computer or mobile device, or hardware-based, like a USB stick. The foremost advantage of a self-custody wallet is the exclusive access you have to your funds, providing a level of security and privacy not typically available with custodial wallets. However, with great power comes great responsibility. If you lose access to your self-custody wallet, either by misplacing the device or forgetting your password, recovery is nearly impossible. This is because there is no third party holding a backup of your private key. In essence, a self-custody wallet grants you total control over your cryptocurrency, giving you both the freedom and the responsibility that comes with it. Your choice here largely depends on your individual needs and comfort level when managing your own security. A self-custody wallet is like being your own bank. You have total control over your cryptocurrencies because you’re the only one with access to your private keys. This gives you maximum privacy and independence but also comes with the responsibility of safeguarding your keys. As my experience suggests, if you’re tech-savvy and value control over convenience, a self-custody wallet could be the right choice for you. On the other hand, a custodial wallet involves a third party, like a cryptocurrency exchange, managing your private keys. This can offer some advantages, such as easier access to trading and other services, and the possibility of account recovery if you forget your password. However, it also means you’re trusting another entity with your assets, which could be a risk if that provider is compromised.In my opinion, neither is universally better than the other. It’s about evaluating your personal requirements, understanding the trade-offs, and choosing the solution that fits your needs best. Always remember, “not your keys, not your coins” is a fundamental principle in the crypto world, but the convenience and additional services of custodial solutions can’t be overlooked either. Get the top 50 crypto definitions you need to know in the industry for free Coinbase Wallet stands as a feature-rich and versatile digital wallet catering to the diverse needs of a modern cryptocurrency user. It combines a user-friendly interface with robust security measures, making it an attractive choice for novice and experienced users. At its core, Coinbase Wallet provides enhanced security to safeguard users’ crypto wealth. It supports compatibility with hardware wallets like KeepKey, Ledger, and Trezor, adding an extra layer of security. This integration ensures a comprehensive system for securing cryptocurrency both online and offline. Furthermore, the wallet’s security is bolstered by the Secure Enclave feature, a sophisticated technology developed by Coinbase for protecting private and public keys. Biometric authentication adds another dimension to this security, ensuring that access to crypto funds is restricted to authorized users only. Additionally, optional cloud backups are available. They offer a safety net for recovering lost private keys and crypto assets. One of the unique aspects of Coinbase Wallet is its functionality in the realm of digital collectibles. As non-fungible tokens (NFTs), such as Crypto Punks and Kitties, gain popularity in the digital consumer marketplace, the wallet provides a seamless solution for storing these NFTs. Moreover, it facilitates NFT sales and purchases across the internet, thus integrating the wallet into the vibrant NFT market. While Coinbase Exchange offers built-in insurance, Coinbase Wallet extends a vendor insurance policy to its users. This policy is designed to protect users’ funds against security breaches, malicious activities, fraud, and vandalism. It ensures that users are covered for losses if someone gains unauthorized access to their wallets. To enhance its user experience, Coinbase Wallet underwent significant updates on December 5, 2023. These updates include the ability to send crypto via text message on popular social media messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. Global, instant, and free money transfers to friends and family directly within messaging and social media apps through a secure link from the wallet emphasize its commitment to user convenience. In addition to these features, Coinbase Wallet allows users to connect their cryptocurrency bank accounts. This functionality streamlines transactions with digital currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, ensures that funds are managed directly on the user’s device, and eliminates the need for centralized brokerage or exchanges in the transaction process. In summary, Coinbase Wallet offers a comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly platform for managing cryptocurrencies and digital collectibles. Its advanced security features, combined with the innovative approach to NFTs and peer-to-peer transactions, position it as a leading choice in the digital wallet space. Yes, Coinbase Wallet is generally considered safe. In fact, many view Coinbase Wallet as one of the safest hot wallets available today. Its robust security measures, like 2FA, biometric authentication technology, and Secure Enclave for private key protection, play a key role in securing user assets. Plus, its recovery phrase feature provides a safety net in case of device loss.  Coinbase Wallet gives users complete control over a wide range of crypto assets. Account holders can easily connect their existing exchange accounts to the wallet. Apart from being convenient, this also provides a crucial layer of protection in case of mismanagement of funds, such as the November 2022 FTX bankruptcy. In the event of a security breach or unexpected loss of digital assets, Coinbase Wallet has an additional layer of protection against potential security threats — insurance coverage for user funds. Still, it’s worth remembering that even Coinbase Wallet isn’t completely invulnerable. As a hot wallet, it’s perpetually online and, therefore, more susceptible to online threats compared to cold storage solutions. Moreover, its linkage to Coinbase’s services means any security or service issues at Coinbase could have a ripple effect on users. Also, user mistakes can lead to loss of funds. Misplacing a recovery phrase, for example, could result in permanent wallet access loss. Conversely, if a malicious party discovers a user’s recovery phrase, they could gain unauthorized access. While Coinbase Wallet stands out for its cost-efficiency and user control, its history is not without security breaches. In 2021, a security flaw in Coinbase’s account recovery system led to at least 6,000 Coinbase user accounts being compromised. However, the company quickly rectified the vulnerability and reimbursed affected users. Despite the 2021 incident, Coinbase has shown resilience against numerous infiltration attempts. In 2019, Coinbase’s security detected and thwarted a large-scale attack that could have resulted in billions of dollars in losses. This attack, involving spear phishing, social engineering, and zero-day exploits, earned Coinbase commendation for its deft handling. Nonetheless, as the 2021 incident underscored, user accounts on the crypto exchange aren’t impervious to hacking. If advanced hackers access personal information, such as your address, passwords, and phone number, they could potentially gain access to your account without even needing to infiltrate Coinbase systems. If you’re looking for safer alternatives, consider hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger for cold storage or software wallets like Electrum for a balance between usability and security. Remember, security in the crypto world is a constant trade-off between safety, convenience, and user control. Always factor in your personal needs, technical capability, and risk tolerance when choosing a wallet. And ensure you use a strong password to enhance the security of your chosen wallet. Coinbase Wallet offers a range of services to its users, including support for Ethereum ERC-20 tokens, a link to DeFi projects, and participation in airdrops, ICOs, and NFT collections. The wallet also allows users to browse dApps and shop at crypto-friendly stores, making it a one-stop base for all things crypto. Users can connect with Coinbase customer support through the wallet app or their website’s support page. In case of any issues, they can also reach out to Coinbase’s support team via email or phone. The fee structure for Coinbase Wallet is designed to be straightforward and transparent, ensuring users are aware of potential costs associated with their transactions. Since there are no fees for transfers between Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase Exchange, users benefit from the seamless movement of cryptocurrencies between the two platforms without additional costs. However, users should keep in mind that when transacting on the blockchain, network fees, commonly known as miner fees, may apply. These fees are not specific to Coinbase but are part of the blockchain’s transaction processing requirements. The amount of these fees can vary — it depends on several factors, including network congestion and the size of the transaction. This means that fees can fluctuate, and the current state of the network matters greatly. When engaging with decentralized applications (dApps) or making transactions on the Ethereum network, users may incur gas fees. These fees are necessary for the execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and can vary depending on the complexity of the transaction and the current network demand. Additionally, Coinbase Wallet has implemented a fee of 1% on swap transactions. This fee applies when users exchange one type of cryptocurrency or token for another within the wallet. The revenue generated from this fee is reinvested into the wallet’s overall functionality, contributing to the development and maintenance of the platform. In this part, we’ll closely examine Coinbase Wallet’s pros and cons so that you can determine if it’s the right wallet for you. Let’s dive in! Coinbase Wallet has a wide range of use cases that cater to various user types. To existing Coinbase users, the wallet offers an additional layer of security and control over their assets. They can easily transfer their crypto assets to the wallet and enjoy the benefits of decentralized storage. People with diversified crypto portfolios can also benefit from using Coinbase Wallet: after all, it supports various types of cryptocurrencies like ERC-20 tokens and has a user-friendly interface that allows for easy trading and exchanges. Users can access and manage their assets from different devices and switch between a hot and a cold wallet for added security. NFT traders can take advantage of Coinbase Wallet’s support for digital collectibles. The wallet supports non-fungible tokens, making it an excellent choice for those interested in the NFT market. The advantages of Coinbase Wallet are numerous. It offers users easy access to exchanges and transactions without a third-party service. Additionally, the wallet gives users control over their assets and eliminates the need for custodial accounts. Users can also enjoy regular security audits and extra layers of security, such as biometric authentication and recovery phrases. The Coinbase Wallet browser extension enhances user experience by allowing seamless access to your wallet directly from your desktop browser.  In my journey exploring Coinbase Wallet, I noticed it’s not without its imperfections. While offering a host of features, it leaves users yearning for more control over their private keys. The wallet’s non-custodial nature is somewhat overshadowed by its reliance on Coinbase’s services, which puts users at the mercy of potential security lapses or service outages on the platform. Furthermore, I’ve observed that the transaction fees can pile up, particularly for smaller transactions — a pitfall one should consider. Adding to the downsides, customer support, in my experience, has room for improvement. The limited responsiveness can cause frustration, especially when urgent help is needed. Lastly, as a product linked to a centralized exchange, Coinbase Wallet may not be suitable for crypto enthusiasts who prioritize decentralized finance and self-custody. The wallet does not support all types of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications, leading to a limited experience for those looking for more flexibility. Overall, while Coinbase Wallet offers convenience and a user-friendly interface, these potential drawbacks should be considered before choosing this wallet as a long-term solution. For users looking for alternative crypto wallets, there are several options available in the market. If you want secure cryptocurrency storage, the Trezor One is considered one of the top-rated hardware wallets. It supports over 1,000 cryptocurrencies and works with all the major computer operating systems. Not only is it easy to set up and use, but it also stores your private keys safely offline, so you don’t have to worry about your funds becoming vulnerable online. Metamask is another great option if you prefer a crypto wallet you can use in your web browser. It’s downloadable as a browser extension for Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Brave, as well as an Apple or Android app, giving users plenty of options when dealing with their coins.  Some other popular alternatives to Coinbase Wallet include Trust Wallet, Atomic Wallet, Exodus, MyEtherWallet, Trezor, and Ledger Nano S. These wallets offer unique features such as additional layers of security, support for various cryptocurrencies, and compatibility with different operating systems. When comparing Coinbase Wallet and Trust Wallet, there are a few key differences that users should be aware of. Coinbase Wallet is more business-friendly and geared towards more experienced crypto investors, allowing for direct access to the Coinbase exchange and trading features. Trust Wallet, on the other hand, is more user-friendly and has a simple interface for beginners, though it lacks direct exchange connections. Both wallets offer ongoing product quality and support features, with security updates and new features being added regularly. However, Coinbase Wallet has the extra benefit of being backed by a well-established and respected cryptocurrency exchange, while Trust Wallet is a stand-alone wallet with no connection to any particular platform. Overall, the choice between Coinbase Wallet and Trust Wallet will depend on the user’s individual needs and preferences. Those looking for direct exchange connections and more advanced trading features may prefer Coinbase Wallet, whereas beginners may find Trust Wallet more user-friendly. Regardless of the choice, ongoing product quality and support will ensure a safe and user-friendly experience. Coinbase Wallet is a digital wallet that allows users to store, manage, and transact various cryptocurrencies. The answer is yes and no. Coinbase Wallet itself is free to download and use, meaning there are no upfront costs or subscription fees to worry about. However, there are transaction fees associated with using the wallet. These fees typically range from 1% to 4% of the transaction value, depending on various factors such as network fees and the type of cryptocurrency being transferred. Network fees can be particularly unpredictable and volatile, as they are determined by current traffic and demand on the blockchain networks that support each cryptocurrency. As such, it’s important to keep an eye on these fees before making any transfers to ensure you’re not overpaying unnecessarily. No, Coinbase and Coinbase Wallet are not the same. Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange platform where users can buy, sell, and trade various cryptocurrencies. It operates more like a brokerage, where the platform holds the cryptocurrency on behalf of its users, and they do not have direct access to their private keys. On the other hand, Coinbase Wallet is a separate application that functions as a digital wallet, allowing users to store and manage their own cryptocurrency holdings. While both are offered by the same company, their functionalities and purposes are distinct: one is for trading and managing investments on the exchange, and the other is for personal storage and management of cryptocurrency. Withdrawing funds from your Coinbase Wallet is a straightforward process that can be accomplished quickly. First, you should link your Coinbase Wallet to a crypto-friendly bank account. This will allow you to transfer funds directly from your wallet to your bank account. Once your account is linked, navigate to the Withdrawal page in your Coinbase Wallet and select Bank Transfer as the withdrawal option. From there, select the linked bank account, enter the desired withdrawal amount, and submit the request. Processing times may vary depending on the specific bank and network used to complete the transfer. However, once the transaction has been confirmed, your funds will be deposited directly into your bank account. Coinbase is considered a good cryptocurrency wallet by many due to its user-friendly interface, security features, and reliability. It is one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets available, and it offers support for a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase also has insurance coverage for stored funds, which provides an added layer of security. However, some users have reported issues with customer support and high transaction fees.  Coinbase Wallet and Trust Wallet are both non-custodial wallets, offering a similar level of security by allowing users full control over their private keys. Both wallets also support cloud backups, enhancing their safety and recovery options. While their user interfaces are also quite comparable, each wallet has distinct additional features. Trust Wallet supports a variety of cryptocurrencies and enables direct staking within the app, appealing to users interested in earning rewards. On the other hand, Coinbase Wallet offers seamless integration with the Coinbase exchange platform, facilitating easy transactions between the wallet and exchange.  Read our Trust Wallet review here.  Drawing on my experience in the crypto field, I’ve found Coinbase Wallet to be a robust and reliable platform for managing digital assets. Its top-notch security measures, such as cold storage, two-factor authentication, and insurance coverage, offer peace of mind that’s hard to find elsewhere. The wallet is designed for various cryptocurrencies and offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface accessible via mobile apps. Unique features such as a recovery phrase and biometric authentication add an additional layer of security that I personally appreciate. Yet, no solution is perfect. With Coinbase Wallet, the trade-off comes in the form of higher transaction fees and a lesser degree of control over private keys. Also, customer support can leave you waiting, which can be frustrating. Nonetheless, Coinbase Wallet emerges as a trustworthy choice for storing and managing crypto assets. Its drawbacks notwithstanding, it stands tall as a popular choice in the market. If convenience and security top your checklist, Coinbase Wallet shouldn’t disappoint you.

Title: The 3 Top Crypto Coins on Investors Watchlist for October Bull Run: Lunex Network, Ethereum and Tron
Date: 11. October 2024
Content:
The last quarter of 2024 holds a lot of promise for crypto investors. Given the over 70% surge of the crypto market cap in 2024 so far, investors are forecasting more rallies in the coming weeks. According to popular analyst Sensei, this is the last dip before a market rally.  In view of this, the top coins that a significant number of investors are currently adding to their portfolios include Lunex Network, Ethereum, and Tron. As the only presale token in the list, Lunex Network’s next-generation DeFi exchange is projected to trigger more DeFi adoption. Find out why these tokens are on investors’ radars below.   The Lunex Network (LNEX) DeFi project is turning out to be one of the first and fastest-growing community-backed DeFi protocols on the blockchain. Lunex Network harbors strong utility such as facilitating cross-chain transactions, allowing traders to swap assets anonymously, and more. As a result of these strong use cases, the $LNEX native token presale has been surging in growth. For context, the $LNEX first-stage presale was sold out within 72 hours, with over 65% of the allocated tokens for stage 2 already sold. Given the massive rush for the token, now is the best time to buy LNEX at $0.0013. Analyst project 100x in the short term.  Meanwhile, The Lunex Network also stands out with an ecosystem that consists of a mobile exchange that enables over 50,000 spot trading exchanges across multiple blockchains. The project also supports multicurrency staking, which allows users to stake cryptos such as Bitcoin. Notably, users can stake their cryptos for 30 days or more and earn up to 18% in APY rewards.  Going forward, users can also use cryptos as collateral to obtain short-term loans in fiat or cryptos. The non-custodial wallet allows users to sell, buy and swap assets seamlessly. Unlike other applications, the Lunex Network portfolio tracker allows investors to track multiple assets. Overall, With Lunex Networks’ innovative ecosystem, analysts anticipate massive growth soon. Drawing insight from the price movements of Ethereum (ETH) over the last two years, a crypto analyst called Ali_charts on X is backing the coin to go on a rally toward the $6,000 threshold. Ali’s analysis is conditioned on the possibility that Ethereum’s price maintains support above the $2,300 mark. In a new analysis, Ali stated that Ethereum is trading inside a symmetrical triangle. The analyst believes a sustained close outside of the $2300 – $2600 range will determine the direction of the ETH price trend. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s attempt to break through the $2500 mark in the past 24 hours was unsuccessful leading to the altcoin struggling at the $2400 mark.  Going forward, Ethereum’s price has dropped by a slight 5% in the past week as per CoinMarketCap. With key market indicators such as the moving averages down, Ethereum bulls will need to keep the price at $2400 to stand a chance of retesting the $2600 mark. However, with the increasing dumping by whales, the dip is the best time to buy Ethereum crypto.  Stats show that the Tron (TRX) token has had a fairly impressive rallying trajectory over the past two years. For context, Justin Sun, the Tron founder on X, pointed out that Tron’s revenue has increased by nearly 1,000% since September 2022 to over $220 million. In the same way, the Tron crypto token has seen over 78% growth in the YTD price metrics as per CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, Tron’s price has surpassed its 3-year price resistance level of $0.14 which it reached in May 2021. Now, the Tron token is valued above $0.15 and is gunning for its all-time high of $0.30. The technical analysis shows that Tron is trading above the 50-day and 200-day EMA with a bullish market sentiment. If the coin is able to break the $0.20 mark, it could mount a challenge at its ATH. With the token’s steady growth in value, now may be the right time to invest in it for significant future gains.  Ethereum and Tron have all shown statistical backing on why they could be good investment alternatives. However, Lunex Network is on an entirely different level, given its early-stage entry advantage and the innovative DeFi ecosystem. As such, it would be logical to prioritize the $LNEX token ahead of Tron and Ethereum.

Title: OSCE hosts workshop aimed at crypto regulation in Eastern Europe
Date: October 11, 2024 at 2:22 pm
Content:

Share  The OSCE’s recent workshop brought together regulators from Ukraine, Moldova, and Armenia to address the urgent need for crypto regulations in the face of rising financial risks. Eastern Europe is doubling down on regulatory measures for crypto exchanges as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe hosts a workshop aimed at enhancing compliance and mitigating financial risks in the digital asset space. In an Oct. 11 press release, the OSCE revealed that from Oct. 9 to Oct. 11, it convened a workshop in Vienna aimed at bolstering the regulatory framework for Virtual Asset Service Providers across Ukraine, Moldova, and Armenia. The event, organized by the Office of the Co-ordinator of OSCE Economic and Environmental Activities, focused on enhancing participants’ ability to “mitigate money laundering and terrorism financing risks within the evolving digital asset ecosystem,” according to the press release. Led by OSCE financial regulation experts, the workshop featured a mix of discussions and interactive sessions designed to engage participants in practical compliance challenges. “This workshop is a vital step in building the capacity of financial regulators to address the growing risks posed by virtual assets.” Vera Strobachova-Budway, acting head of the economic governance unit at OCEEA Key modules addressed pressing issues in VASP compliance, including anti-money laundering measures and counter-terrorism financing strategies. Participants also received “hands-on tools for supervising VASPs and analyzing suspicious activity,” equipping them with advanced skills in identifying and mitigating risks, per the press release. The workshop marks another step in the OSCE’s effort to formalize best practices in crypto regulation, fostering collaboration among regional regulators and financial experts. The initiative is part of a broader project aimed at regulating crypto businesses, supported by Germany, Italy, and the United States, among others. Earlier in August, the OSCE also conducted a three-day training in Warsaw to enhance crypto investigation skills for Armenian and Georgian law enforcement. This specialized session on “countering blockchain obfuscation techniques” was part of ongoing efforts to combat illicit activities facilitated by cryptocurrencies.

Title: We Asked ChatGPT Which Crypto Will Dominate 2025: Avalanche (AVAX), Binance Coin (BNB), Tron (TRX), or Rollblock (RBLK)?
Date: 11. October 2024
Content:
Altcoins were expected to dominate Q4’s bull market, but Avalanche is only trying to escape strong bearish pressure. Meanwhile, BNB and TRON are also trying to regain investor interest after their recent downtrends. Amidst this sentiment, even AI chatbots like ChatGPT know that Rollblock (RBLK) will emerge as the biggest gainer in Q4’s bull run with its revolutionary GambleFi protocol.  Avalanche investors appear to be losing interest in the token as Avalanche’s trading volume is quickly drying up across decentralized exchanges. Since Avalanche is currently testing a key zone on its weekly chart, Avalanche’s price could experience a rebound if it breaks above the resistance. Avalanche is currently trading for $26.34 after an intr-day decrease of 3.15%. As Avalanche trades below its 100-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages, analysts believe Avalanche could fall to the $21.82 support soon.  BNB hasn’t experienced any significant price action for the past four months as BNB’s price has been stuck between the $460-$600 range. Since BNB recently rejected the critical $607 resistance, BNB’s price is now facing a short-term correction. BNB is currently trading for $577.91 after a minor intraday increase of 0.62%. Since BNB has recorded impressive 3.01% gains over the last seven days, analysts believe BNB could turn bullish soon. If buying pressure picks up, BNB could test the critical resistance at $633.7 in the upcoming weeks.  TRON’s network has recently experienced a huge rise in stablecoin activity as whales made use of TRON’s low transaction fees. Since TRON recently outshined Bitcoin and Ethereum by recording the highest Q3 revenue, TRON’s price is expected to regain bullish momentum soon.  TRON is currently trading for $0.1569 after an intraday increase of 0.61%. Since TRON’s volume has also increased by 9.28%, analysts believe a TRON rally is in the making. Since TRON’s RSI is neutral and its MACD has turned positive, TRON is expected to test the $0.1611 resistance soon.  Rollblock’s explosive presale hasn’t gone unnoticed by any savvy trader in the market, and even ChatGPT can’t seem to ignore it now. By raising more than $4 million during its viral presale, Rollblock has already proven its potential as the next 100x crypto in 2025. Not only is Rollblock poised for massive gains, but it also delivers huge staking rewards and exclusive bonuses to its presale holders, making it the top choice for every trader during Q4’s bull market.  By creating an iGambling platform that combines decentralized and centralized gaming experiences, Rollblock is set to own a huge market share of the $500bn per annum global gambling market. Even if Rollblock manages to snatch 1% of the market with its revolutionary crypto-native casino, the platform’s $RBLK token would easily outshine the current Top 10 cryptos by market cap in 2025.  These bullish predictions are fueled by Rollblock’s ingenious strategy to bring Ethereum-backed security to the volatile world of online gambling. Instead of forcing high rollers to struggle with third-party manipulations and privacy concerns, Rollblock is offering a 100% secure and transparent gambling experience with its bet encryption, no-KYC policy, and transparent betting analytics.  To make things even better, Rollblock gives away a huge portion of its weekly casino revenue to long-term holders as staking rewards with up to 18% APY.

 Published on By During his presentation at Token 2049, Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum co-founder, shared his enthusiasm for the coming decade in the crypto sector, emphasizing the achievements thus far and the potential of what’s ahead. Addressing the longstanding belief that crypto is in its infancy, Vitalik said it is akin to the internet’s gradual evolution.  Yet, with over ten years of Bitcoin and Ethereum, crypto itself isn’t in the early stages anymore; however, it’s still early in terms of making it accessible to average users. Essentially, while the technology is prepared, more efforts are required to make it practical for everyday applications. “People tend to say you know this is still early days right, we’re still building out the basic infrastructure, [but] today we are not early to crypto but we are early to crypto actually being usable”, Vitalik added. Vitalik reminisced about the early Bitcoin era in 2013 when the buzz was all about its revolutionary potential to transform payments.  Back then, many businesses tried incorporating Bitcoin into their transactions, but the prohibitive transaction fees, reaching up to $50, and slow processing times soon proved to be major obstacles. He shared an experience in Argentina in 2021, where he discovered cryptocurrency had woven its way into daily life. Yet, instead of embracing decentralized platforms like Ethereum, most turned to centralized exchanges such as Binance for their efficiency and lower costs. Vitalik envisions a future where we can build “digital castles” on Ethereum Historically, exorbitant fees have posed a considerable problem. According to Vitalik, with the advent of “layer 2 solutions” layered over Ethereum, there’s been a dramatic drop in fees to almost negligible levels, allowing for lightning-fast transactions. This innovation effectively tackles one of the primary hurdles of using crypto in everyday scenarios. Another issue has been the complicated user experience of crypto applications. Initially, these apps were clunky and slow. However, they are improving, with user interfaces and designs now resembling the smoothness of modern apps like Twitter or Venmo. Vitalik also emphasized some advanced uses of crypto, such as enhanced privacy features and innovative technologies like “zero-knowledge proofs.” These allow for safer and more private transactions. These technologies go beyond just speed or cost-efficiency, offering new levels of privacy and security. Vitalik stressed that while centralized systems like Venmo or WeChat Pay have improved over the years, crypto offers unique advantages in regions where politics or governments complicate access to finance. In these places, crypto’s decentralized nature becomes incredibly valuable. Read also: Vitalik Buterin speaks on what else memecoins could be Vitalik used the metaphor of “digital concrete” to describe blockchains. Just as concrete builds strong physical structures, blockchains create digital systems that are very difficult to break. These systems are robust and can withstand challenges in ways traditional technologies cannot. Vitalik envisions a future where we can build “digital castles” on Ethereum. These digital structures can serve serious purposes, like protecting wealth and information, and offer fun opportunities, such as creating spaces for entertainment or preserving culture. He believes this blend of practical and creative possibilities makes crypto’s future so exciting.

Title: Donald Trump’s Crypto Platform Expands Reach

 The Trump family’s crypto platform (World Liberty Financial) announced widespread availability today and promises to flip traditional finance on its head.  World Liberty Financial was initially criticized for offering nothing new and only being available to US-accredited investors with a $1M net worth. However, it has since defined its protocol as a ‘permissionless and peer-to-peer digital asset system for everyone’ and integrated Aave to elevate its Ethereum-based utility.  World Liberty Financial announced today that its DeFi protocol will bring together leading blockchain technologies, strategic partnerships, and broad distribution channels built for mass adoption.  It’s debuting a governance platform for $WLFI (its native token) holders to let investors shape the protocol’s development.  Furthermore, it has a solid plan beyond token holder governance: a user-friendly interface available through one-click social logins and wallet setups. Such easy onboarding emphasizes $WLFI’s efforts to increase the platform’s reach. As does its recent Aave partnership. Aave (a platform that lends users over 30 Ethereum-based digital assets) now has a seat at World Liberty Financial’s governance table. World Liberty Financial aims to spice up the Ethereum landscape by deploying Aave V3 (which lets users optimize the borrowing power and yield generation of assets supplied to the Aave Protocol).  It enables the Trump-run platform to deposit and lend $ETH, $WBTC, and popular stablecoins like $USDT and $USDC in the hope of boosting platform utility and the coins’ liquidity.  However, some took to the proposal to express their concerns about the partnership dampening Aave’s reputation – especially considering the 2024 US presidential election is just around the corner.  







 Some Trump fans initially feared that the crypto platform might deter the former president’s chances of winning the 2024 US presidential election on November 5.  However, per Polymarket data (the world’s largest prediction market), Trump is currently leading with 56% of votes. Kamala Harris trails behind with 43.5%. 







 Alongside the election forecast, many tokens tied to Donald Trump (Polifi tokens) have spiked over the past 24 hours, including:    The news shows that the Trump family is making a series of strategic moves to enhance their crypto platform’s demand.  By looking at Trump’s rising political fortunes, the development of $ WLFI could boost his electoral appeal.  As the election draws near, the performance of Trump-based Polifi tokens also serves as an indicator of how the political landscape influences market movements.  Click to expand and view resources  Your email address will not be published.

Title: Crypto Whales Double Down On Ethereum (ETH) And Cutoshi (CUTO): This Is The Start Of The Next Ethereum Coin Takeover - Brave New Coin
Date: Date not available
Content:
The top cryptos whales are accumulating ahead of the altcoin season are Cutoshi and Ethereum. Ethereum, the popular altcoin, has been facing selling pressure in recent weeks. Data from the on-chain crypto market transaction tracker LookinChain shows how whales have continued dumping the Ether token in recent weeks. The impact of the selling pressure is also seen in the Ethereum ETF inflows, which show a negative 3,968ETH (—$9.69M) in the past day. Amid the drop, smart whales are using the dip to accumulate more ETH tokens, while some are diversifying to the Cutoshi ongoing presale, which is dubbed the next Popcat. With the backing of a multichain DEX exchange designed to solve common issues in CEX, CUTO is projected for 100x in the coming weeks. More details below. Cutoshi is a revolutionary Ethereum-based meme coin that aims to solve common issues in DEX and CEX exchanges. Following the core principles of Satoshi Nakamoto and the traditional Chinese Lucky Cat, Cutoshi is building an ecosystem in which investors are given decision-making powers and control. The ecosystem will follow the principles of freedom, privacy, anonymity, and monetary empowerment, which are DeFi’s core agenda. In essence, the ecosystem is following Nakamoto’s visions for blockchain technology which are decentralization, privacy, and monetary empowerment. To accomplish these goals, Cutoshi is building a unique ecosystem that is different from what is obtainable in the market. One of the major features of the Cutoshi ecosystem is a multichain DEX exchange, which allows for cross-chain asset swapping without a third party. This solves issues of privacy and security. Other features worth noting are the Cutoshi University, farming protocol, and NFT merchandise, designed to enhance user experience and boost investors’ income. Meanwhile, the team has raised over $300K at the ongoing presale, which could hit $1M soon. The native token CUTO is sold for $0.015. Some analysts think that with the rising momentum, it will offer much more ROI than Popcat, which saw over 1000% growth within days of listing. As such, with the 440M limited supply, investors have little time to join before the price rallies. Having faced selling pressure in the past week, Ethereum’s price has continued to struggle. CoinMarketCap data shows that Ethereum has declined below the $2500 mark, with trading volume also in a downward trend. The increased selling pressure is also noticed in the Ethereum market cap which has dropped from $451B in early June to less than $300B. Ali Martinez, a popular crypto analyst on X, maintained that Ethereum’s price needs to hold support above $2300 to stand a chance of bouncing back towards the $6000 mark. Ali thinks a drop below the zone could push Ether’s price to $1600. Meanwhile, the overall Ethereum market sentiment is worrisome as the ETH price is below the 50-day and 200-day EMA. Other key market indicators, such as the MACD and RSI, are neutral. A further look at the daily Ethereum chart pattern shows it has failed five attempts at surpassing the $2,420 mark, which served as a previous support zone. Even at that, smart whales are using the dip to accumulate the crypto with Coincodex Ethereum price prediction around the $2596 mark in the short term.  Source: Tradingview The last quarter of every year is one of the favorites in the crypto space, with top cryptos witnessing significant rallies. With Bitcoin already sitting comfortably above the $60K mark, altcoins will soon head to the moon. Given the high price of Ethereum, investors might consider cheaper alternatives like Cutoshi, which is witnessing massive adoption.

Title: What If I Invest $100 in Bitcoin Today?

No matter if it’s 2014 or 2024, when it comes to crypto, Bitcoin has always been and will likely always be the first cryptocurrency people think of. Especially during times when the crypto market is going up—a lot of people start getting FOMO and thinking, ‘What if I invested $100 in Bitcoin 1, 5, 10 years ago?’ Investing $100 in Bitcoin today might seem small, but it has the potential for significant returns over time. Bitcoin, the world’s most recognized cryptocurrency, has gone through many massive price shifts since its creation in 2009. It’s important to understand the risks involved with Bitcoin’s volatile nature. By looking at its price history, potential growth, and investment methods, you can better assess if Bitcoin fits your investment goals. Table of Contents If you’re thinking about investing $100 in Bitcoin (BTC) today, you can still make a profit if the BTC price goes up to $100K or higher. There are many Bitcoin price predictions and forecasts out there, and plenty of experts believe the world’s largest cryptocurrency will keep rising. Bitcoin, the world’s first and most well-known cryptocurrency, is no stranger to massive growth spurts, having experienced plenty of them since its creation in 2009. The cryptocurrency market has made headlines for its big price swings, and many people see Bitcoin as a key part of the future of finance. However, the road to profit isn’t always smooth. When Bitcoin first launched, it was worth less than a penny. Today, Bitcoin’s value fluctuates dramatically, but it has already reached all-time highs of over $60,000 per coin. Just a decade ago, a $100 investment in Bitcoin would have made you a millionaire by now. But that doesn’t mean Bitcoin’s future price will always follow the same path. Let’s look at an example. If you had bought Bitcoin in 2013 when it was worth around $100, your $100 would have bought one Bitcoin. By 2024, when Bitcoin had hit its peak around $60,000, that single Bitcoin would have made your $100 investment worth $60,000! Bitcoin’s potential for growth has captured the interest of investors, especially with Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) now making it easier to invest without directly buying Bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges. But remember, the Bitcoin market is volatile. Prices can go up or down sharply, and it’s possible to lose money. To balance out these risks, some investors diversify their portfolios and include stocks, bonds, and even cryptocurrencies like Ethereum alongside Bitcoin investments. While we can’t predict Bitcoin’s future price with certainty, we can look at historical data to estimate how much a $100 investment in Bitcoin today might grow. Here’s a breakdown of potential outcomes based on past performance: Keep in mind, though, that past performance isn’t a guarantee of future results. The cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, is incredibly volatile. Prices can skyrocket or crash within days or even hours. While some see huge gains, others lose money. Therefore, it’s wise to approach Bitcoin with caution and treat it as a small part of a diversified investment portfolio. Even in 2024, Bitcoin remains one of the most popular investments. Over the years, it has attracted many investors who regard it as a valuable digital asset. Investing $100 in Bitcoin is a great way to start exploring the cryptocurrency world without risking too much. There are several ways to go about it, and each method offers different levels of involvement, risk, and potential reward. Below are the most common methods you can use to invest $100 in Bitcoin today. One of the easiest and most popular ways to invest $100 in Bitcoin is by buying it through a cryptocurrency exchange. These platforms allow you to trade fiat currency, like US dollars, for Bitcoin and other crypto assets. To start, you’ll need to create a cryptocurrency exchange account, verify your identity, and deposit your $100. After that, you can purchase Bitcoin directly. Some of the most well-known exchanges include: This method is straightforward and accessible, making it a great choice for those new to Bitcoin markets. After buying Bitcoin, you can store it in the exchange’s wallet or transfer it to a more secure private wallet. If you want to buy Bitcoin instantly, you will need a secure crypto wallet, a reputable cryptocurrency exchange, and a payment method, be it fiat money or another crypto asset. Another convenient way to invest $100 in Bitcoin is through mobile investment apps. These apps often provide a simple, user-friendly experience, perfect for beginners. Many of them enable you to buy Bitcoin using a debit or credit card, so it is easy to get started. Some popular apps for crypto investments include: Apps like these simplify the buying process and make it easy to invest small amounts in Bitcoin over time. Bitcoin mining can seem complex, but one way to participate with just $100 is by joining a mining pool. Through a mining pool, individuals combine their computing power to mine Bitcoin together, splitting the rewards. While $100 won’t buy you expensive mining equipment, you can contribute a small amount and receive a portion of the Bitcoin mined by the pool. Keep in mind that Bitcoin mining has become more competitive over the years. The rewards may be small, especially if your initial investment is limited, but it is a way to passively earn Bitcoin. Plus, this method gives you a deeper connection to how Bitcoin transactions and the blockchain technology behind them actually work. If you’re looking for a more passive way to invest your $100, consider Bitcoin savings accounts or platforms where you can earn interest on your Bitcoin. These platforms let you deposit your Bitcoin, and in return, you receive interest over time. Some popular platforms include: This method allows you to earn a return on your $100 investment without the need to constantly trade or monitor the Bitcoin markets. However, there are risks, as these platforms are not insured like traditional bank savings accounts. For those who don’t want to deal with the technicalities of buying and storing Bitcoin directly, investing in a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) or fund is a simpler alternative. These financial products allow you to invest in Bitcoin through traditional financial markets without owning the cryptocurrency itself. Bitcoin ETFs are available on some major stock exchanges and give investors exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements—moreover, managing a cryptocurrency exchange account or wallet is not required. This option is ideal for those who want to keep their Bitcoin investment tied to a more familiar system, especially if they are already comfortable with stock market investments. If you don’t want to spend the full $100 upfront, Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is a strategy that allows you to invest smaller amounts over time. Instead of buying $100 worth of Bitcoin all at once, you could spread your purchases over days or weeks, investing a fixed amount, such as $10 per week. This method helps reduce the impact of market volatility by averaging out your purchase price over time. This approach is especially useful in the volatile crypto market, where Bitcoin prices can fluctuate rapidly. With DCA, you invest consistently, taking advantage of both market dips and rallies. Get the top 50 crypto definitions you need to know in the industry for free If you have a high risk tolerance and are looking for exposure to a potentially high-reward, speculative investment, Bitcoin in 2024 may be worth considering. With institutional support, reduced supply, and its role as a hedge against inflation, it offers long-term potential. That said, remember that Bitcoin remains volatile, and cryptocurrency investments should only be a small part of a diversified portfolio. If you can handle the ups and downs, Bitcoin could be a valuable part of your strategy. Bitcoin’s current price has surpassed $60,000, a solid recovery from the lows of the 2022 bear market. Let’s take a closer look at factors affecting BTC’s value. The halving event in April 2024 reduced the block reward for miners from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Historically, this scarcity has driven prices upward 9–12 months after each halving. Although immediate surges may not be apparent, reduced Bitcoin supply can potentially support long-term price growth, mirroring trends seen in previous cycles. Read more about Bitcoin halvings. Institutional interest has surged in 2024, especially with the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. These ETFs let traditional investors gain exposure to Bitcoin through regulated financial products, increasing demand and liquidity. This development is encouraging for those seeking lower-risk exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the digital asset. Learn more about Bitcoin ETFs. With central banks continuing to adjust policies in response to inflation, Bitcoin has gained traction as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Its finite supply and decentralized nature make it appealing to investors seeking an alternative to traditional assets, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. Despite these positives, Bitcoin remains a high-risk investment. Its price is prone to sharp fluctuations, making it a speculative investment. In 2022, Bitcoin lost 65% of its value, though it has rebounded by over 300% since the start of 2023. This kind of volatility requires a solid risk tolerance, as prices can swing unpredictably due to factors like regulatory changes, macroeconomic trends, or shifts in market sentiment. Yes, it can be. Nevertheless, please remember that Bitcoin remains a volatile asset, so its value can fluctuate dramatically.  Still, with increasing interest from institutional investors and the growing adoption of digital currencies, some now view Bitcoin as a good long-term investment. Ultimately, your decision should depend on your investment goals and risk tolerance. As always, be prepared for price swings. Bitcoin’s value comes from its limited supply (only 21 million coins), decentralized nature, and widespread demand. Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, Bitcoin operates on decentralized exchanges without middlemen. Its underlying blockchain technology also ensures security and transparency. The future value of $100 in Bitcoin is uncertain due to its volatile nature. Historical trends show significant price increases over long periods, but past performance is no guarantee of future results. It depends on market demand, technological developments, and regulatory changes. Check out our Bitcoin price prediction for 2025, 2026–2030. Bitcoin’s price was around $10,000 in 2019, so $100 would have bought approximately 0.01 BTC. With the current price of BTC at the time of writing hovering around $60,000, that $100 investment would now be worth roughly $600. Yes, it’s possible to make money from Bitcoin due to its historical price appreciation. However, its volatile nature means prices can drop as quickly as they rise. If you’re investing $100, be prepared for both gains and losses, depending on the market. Yes, it’s possible to make money from Bitcoin due to its historical price appreciation.

	Crypto gets hammered in America, rebounds in Asia

 The cryptocurrency market lost 0.2% in 24 hours to $2.12 trillion but saw a fresh drop in the US session during the day before rebounding on buying in lower volumes in Asian trading on Friday morning. The Sentiment Index fell to its lowest level in over a month at 32 (fear). Since the beginning of the week, Bitcoin's intraday momentum has been dominated by declines during the US session. The intensification of the sell-off was clearly visible on Wednesday and Thursday, with losses from peak to trough exceeding 3%. The first cryptocurrency fell below $59K before recovering to $60.5K at the time of writing. The momentum of the previous day's sell-off sent BTCUSD below its 50-day MA, and on the morning's recovery, the price is attempting to move higher again. Ethereum was back at $2,400 on Friday, where it started the week. The rally we saw at the end of last week failed to develop, and the failure to make the local low was another touch of the 200-week MA, a long-term support line from which it has failed to break away for the ninth week. Ethereum was only weaker in 2020. According to QCP Capital, the rise in funding rates for perpetual contracts indicates the cryptocurrency market’s vulnerability to a correction. In the medium and long term, the experts remain bullish and recommend applying accumulation strategies, betting on the short-term nature of the correction. OXT Research noted that some 7,000 ETH worth $16.7 million seized from the organisers of the PlusToken cryptocurrency pyramid scheme have been transferred to exchanges. This could mean the sale of all remaining ~542,000 ETH worth $1.3 billion. The vast majority of PlusToken’s bitcoins, about $1.3 billion, were sold between 2019 and 2020. SEC chief Gary Gensler said Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be seen in the future as a store of value rather than a widely used payment instrument. He cited the 19th-century Copernicus-Gresham Law, which states that ‘bad money drives out good money’ and that countries prefer to have only one type of money. Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee of bankrupt crypto exchange Mt. Gox, said in an official letter that the deadline to compensate affected creditors will be extended for another year, until 31 October 2025.

                 Bitcoin steadies above $60,000 on Friday, gains over 1% on the day. Ethereum trades above $2,400, while BlackRock Spot Ethereum ETF sees a $17.8 million inflow on Thursday. XRP is back above $0.5300 as Ripple files cross-appeal in SEC lawsuit. Cardano ambassador Mauro Andreoli recently announced Cardano’s milestone of Argentina’s first legally and judicially enforceable contract. The first loan agreement in Cardano under Argentine law involves a loan of 10,000 ADA tokens, currently valued at $3,380. Bitcoin is finding support around the key level, and a close below this level could signal a decline. Ethereum is approaching a critical resistance barrier; rejection from this level suggests a decline ahead. Meanwhile, Ripple is stuck in a range, reflecting a period of indecision among traders. SEC sued crypto trading company Cumberland DRW for allegedly acting as an unregistered broker. Solana was among five cryptocurrencies the SEC alleged to be securities sold via the platform. Bitcoin price declined over 6% this week until Friday as the escalation of the conflict between Iran and Israel added fuel to this sell-off. The decline was also supported by falling institutional demand for ETFs. BTC bulls seem to be holding strong at a critical support level.

Title: Daily Crypto Update: Market Stabilizes, Traders Remain Cautious
Date: October 11, 2024
Content:
The crypto market is showing signs of stability before the weekend. Bitcoin is staying above the 60,500-dollar mark, while Ethereum still stands at 2,400 dollars. Big names like XRP, Cardano, and Toncoin are defying bearish sentiments. However, the Fear and Greed Index still shows concerning signs. According to Cointree, the metric stands at 32, indicating a growing level of fear among traders.  Meanwhile, emerging coins like Bonk, Popcat, and Dogwifhat are gaining market precedence. Here is a quick overview of the crypto market with the latest developments to help traders. BTC managed to stay above the 60,500 dollar mark on Thursday. The market leader only lost 0.52% value in 24 hours, currently trading at 60,569 dollars. The coin has dropped 0.99% in value in the past seven days. BTC is witnessing a crash since whales keep selling off their Bitcoin stack. The coin has a support level of 58,685 dollars, while its resistance level is 60,997 dollars.  Bitcoin is anticipated to challenge the resistance level over the weekend, given the current circumstances. Advertisement Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin, registering a meagre 0.04% dip in the past 24 hours. The second-biggest crypto is maintaining a stand above the 2,400-dollar mark.  With a 1.01% surge in the past week, Ethereum is currently trading at 2,404 dollars. The fear among traders is natural, seeing as Fidelity reported a breach, leaking the data of 77,000 customers. Ethereum’s 24-hour trading volume has surged 3.14% in the past 24 hours, with traders putting more faith in ETH. XRP defied bearish sentiment by securing a 1.27% growth in 24 hours. The coin is trading above the 0.5-dollar mark with a 1.07% weekly surge. Its 24-hour trading volume has witnessed a 51.70% growth, hitting 1.28 billion dollars. Despite the surge, traders are showing concern as the SEC is trying to tighten its grip on XRP. In the meantime, analysts are predicting a 2 to 5-times jump in XRP’s price. Popcat, the SOL-based meme coin, jumped 6.51% in the past 24 hours. It is currently trading at 1.26 dollars and is eyeing the 1.5-dollar mark. Its 24-hour trading volume is at 133.32 million dollars, showing a 24.58% jump. Its market cap has also taken a leap of 7.44%, reaching 1.26 billion dollars. POPCAT is expected to experience a significant increase in the coming weeks, making it a profitable investment option. Advertisement NEIRO, or First Neiro, on Ethereum, has lost 16.04% in the past 24 hours. The coin has surged 66.18% in the past seven days, while its monthly performance shows a 3541% surge. Despite the monthly jump, Neiro has lost 17.83% in 24-hour trading volume. The coin is constantly fluctuating, making it only ideal for high-risk, high-reward investors.  Advertisement

Title: How Can Crypto Enthusiasts Protect Themselves When Starting Staking? | HackerNoon
Date: Date not available
Content:
      By Armagan Ercan & Philippe Schommers    Since the completion of the Shanghai upgrade, the amount of staked ETH has increased by 91%. But to the uninitiated, staking crypto may come across as intimidating, what with price volatility, security concerns, and the risk of frozen assets stoking fears. So how can crypto enthusiasts better protect themselves when they start their staking journeys? The term staking derives from the “proof-of-stake” consensus mechanism used to secure blockchain networks like Ethereum or Gnosis Chain. Users become validators by choosing to stake some of their cryptocurrency with a selected network to validate new transactions, operating as part of a validator node.    A validator node will be selected based on the collective amount of crypto they have staked to validate new transactions and be subsequently rewarded with crypto. This, however, requires a consistent online presence, which usually would equate to roughly 6 months of the year in order to be profitable for the operator.  node operators can often be penalised for downtime.    Should users not wish to become a validator, they can pay a fee to a staking pool and delegate their stakes to a larger pool through protocols like StakeWise. This way, they can still earn staking rewards without having to maintain a constant online presence. Staking plays an important role in securing proof-of-stake networks while offering investors and network participants the chance to earn passive income. A natural flow is established and investors' investments are kept in a more secure network.    This process makes it more difficult for malicious actors to attack the blockchain, thus enhancing its stability and security. Although staking cryptocurrencies is attractive for these reasons, it is important to remember that staking potential should not be the only factor in investment decisions. When becoming a validator, users must also account for penalties for acting against the network's best interests. These include validating fraudulent transactions, using incorrect data or node downtime. By committing these, they risk having their staked crypto “slashed” and taken as forfeit.    A network's staking requirements can differ vastly from one project to another. On Ethereum and Gnosis Chain for example, unless voluntarily acting against the best interests of the network, a validator can only ever be penalised as much in one day for being offline than they'd be rewarded in a day by being online.    However, other projects might have more stringent requirements, whereby stakers could lose their stake simply by not having a perfect track record. Some do not have any requirements and merely avoid paying out rewards to offline nodes.    Regardless of staking requirements, factors like network security, decentralization level and participation barriers, smart contract quality, team experience, and project maturity all contribute to the risk profile.    Think of it as investing in a new company. Before deciding to part with an investment, would an investor not first do the due diligence to understand the quality and conditions of what they are putting their money into?    Investors or node operators should review the security documents and risk analysis report of the network and decide whether it is battle-tested or not as a result of their own research. A simple yet devastating mistake is improperly securing private keys. If private keys are not secured correctly, then malicious actors can compromise the security of the network and steal staked crypto. There are several solutions such as using secure hardware to store private keys or self-custody/cold wallets. However, the inverse is also relevant as over securing private keys can also lead to losing access to wallets, so users should aim to strike a balance between the two.    Similarly, a lot of stakers neglect tax considerations. If staking rewards are treated as income, they will be subject to income tax and if they are seen as capital gains, they will be subject to the relevant capital gains tax. The main focus should be on security to maximize returns and minimize risks. After that, consider diversifying staking portfolios, compounding rewards regularly, and staying informed about network changes. Liquid staking options which allow stakers to access their staked crypto to use as collateral offer more flexibility but have their own trade-offs.    However, no matter what new technology is on offer or how enticing the programme's rewards are, it’s essential to do thorough research and set realistic expectations for returns before starting staking.

Title: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Tumbles Below $59K Amid Inflation Worry, SEC Lawsuit
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by Cryptocurrencies continue to face headwinds on a number of fronts, with Thursday bringing a faster-than-hoped inflation report for September and yet another U.S. government regulatory action against a sector participant. In mid-afternoon U.S. trading, bitcoin (BTC) was lower by about 4% over the past 24 hours. At $59,000, the price has returned to levels not seen since the U.S. Federal Reserve unexpectedly slashed its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in mid-September. Altcoins outperformed somewhat, with the broad-based crypto benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index declining just under 3% during the same period. Ether (ETH) dropped 3.5%, while only decentralized exchange Uniswaps's token (UNI) had positive return during the day on news about the platform's own layer-2 plans. Crypto began the day on a weak foot after the U.S. Consumer Price Index report showed an unexpected re-acceleration of inflation in September. The news seemingly drove a stake through any idea that the Fed could cut interest rates another 50 basis points in November, with some market participants now wondering if the U.S. central bank might even decide to pause its rate-cutting cycle at that meeting. "Hot CPI and oil price spike due to Middle East tensions have created a fear that the Fed will not cut as much as the market previously thought," Quinn Thompson, founder of hedge fund Lekker Capital, said in a Telegram message. "Mix in [Atlanta Fed President] Bostic's hawkish comments today regarding a potential pause and that's the tinder to run the levered traders' stops." Indeed, the sell-off liquidated some $147 million of leveraged long positions betting on higher prices across crypto derivatives markets, CoinGlass data shows. Prices dived even lower during afternoon hours following news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued major digital asset market maker Cumberland DRW, raising concerns once again about the challenging regulatory environment for U.S. crypto firms. The SEC alleged DRW traded crypto assets that were sold as securities without registering as a securities dealer. Cumberland pushed back against the lawsuit in an X post, saying that "we are not making any changes to our business operations or the assets in which we provide liquidity as a result of this action by the SEC." The SEC lawsuit was only the latest regulatory action by the U.S. government against crytpo this week. On Wednesday, the Department of Justice charged four market makers and more than a dozen individuals over market manipulation charges. Also Wednesday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler was very dismissive about the idea that bitcoin or crypto might catch on in any sort of significant way as a means of payment. He called out the crypto industry for being filled with "fraudsters," and asserted that the "leading lights" of the sector were either in jail or soon to be on their way behind bars. "There's going to be a lot of noise between now and [the U.S.] election [in November] and it's likely bitcoin is just range bound until then," Lekker's Thompson added.

	Crypto Today: Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP gain on Friday, meme coin NEIRO erases recent gains

 NEIRO gained over 70% at some point in October. The meme coin trades at $0.00155934 at the time of writing and could erase its newfound gains, sweeping liquidity at the upper boundary of a Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $0.00128254, as seen in the NEIRO/USDT daily chart below.  The support level coincides with the 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for the meme coin.  The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows red histogram bars under the neutral line, signaling negative underlying momentum in NEIRO price trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 57.01, close to neutral.   NEIRO/USDT daily chart A daily candlestick close above resistance at $0.00170158 could invalidate the bearish thesis, and NEIRO could rally toward its October 9 peak of $0.00194929.  I will be attending the Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai on Oct 30-31, in my personal capacity. It’s one of the biggest web3 events of the year. See you there. ✊  Bitcoin has dropped as low as $58.9K today, returning to a 3-week low. However, traders are identifying this as a dip buy opportunity. The narrative flipped to bullish particularly after the US CPI report announced still likely expected rate cuts. pic.twitter.com/Yet0YTjeiL

           This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2024 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. FAQ - New Privacy Policy SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda discusses the agency's handling of cryptocurrency on 'Mornings with Maria.' The Securities and Exchange Commission still firmly believes that the cryptocurrency XRP is a security, FOX Business has learned. The revelation comes following a lawsuit filed in an Illinois district court Thursday evening by crypto derivatives exchange Bitnomial, which sued Wall Street’s top cop over its claim that it has jurisdiction over a planned futures contract that tracks the price of XRP, the seventh-largest digital asset by market cap. Bitnomial, which is regulated by the SEC’s sister agency the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, filed for the XRP US Dollar Futures contract in August following the conclusion of the SEC’s lawsuit against blockchain payments firm Ripple, where a federal judge ruled against the SEC’s claim that XRP is a security. EXODUS DONATES $1.3M TO CRYPTO ADVOCACY GROUP TO AID ELECTION DAY VOTE EFFORTS According to Bitnomial’s lawsuit, the SEC contacted the exchange shortly after the filing, claiming that XRP Futures are "security futures" that are subject to joint SEC and CFTC jurisdiction, and that Bitnomial would be violating federal securities laws if it proceeded with the listing. The SEC also said Bitnomial would be required to comply with additional requirements before listing XRP Futures, including registering as a national securities exchange. "The SEC takes the view that the underlying asset, XRP, is an investment contract and, therefore, transactions in XRP constitute a security under the Securities Exchange Act," the lawsuit states. "Bitnomial disagrees with the SEC’s view that XRP is an investment contract and, therefore, a security, and that XRP Futures are thus security futures." The SEC had no immediate comment.  TETHER LOOKS TO REVAMP US IMAGE AS IT CELEBRATES 10 YEARS The number of people worldwide that own at least $1 million worth of cryptocurrency has soared over the past year. (iStock) The SEC's claim that XRP futures are securities futures is a further escalation in the turf war between the securities regulator and the commodities regulator, which are currently vying for sole jurisdiction over digital assets. The biggest question remains whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities or commodities and, in the absence of a regulatory framework, the status of certain tokens is being decided by the courts. The CFTC currently oversees futures contracts for bitcoin and ether, the only two digital assets the SEC has deemed to be non-securities. Signage is seen outside of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 30, 2020. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly (Reuters Photos) In addition to seeking a declaration from a judge that XRP Futures are not securities futures, Bitnomial is asking the court to issue an order that prevents the SEC from claiming authority over XRP Futures and taking any legal action against the exchange related to its product offering.  "Establishing this precedent is not just about XRP; it’s about all digital assets," Bitnomial CEO Luke Hoersten tells FOX Business.  "Unlike other U.S. businesses in litigation with the SEC, Bitnomial has not been accused of wrongdoing," he said. "As such, we are in a unique position to push for a court decision on the securities or commodities classification of XRP futures following the landmark determination as a non-security in the Southern District of New York case."  Bitnomial's case puts the hotly-contested issue of whether XRP is a security back in a district court at the same time as the issue could be put before the Second Circuit.  CRYPTO ASSET MANAGER BITWISE FILES FOR FIRST XRP EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said the agency's crypto approach has been "really a disaster for the whole industry." (Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images / Getty Images) The SEC filed a notice of appeal in the Ripple case last week, signaling that it will likely contest a New York federal judge's decision that XRP, when traded on exchanges, is not a security. Ripple filed a notice of cross-appeal on Thursday, but neither entity has disclosed the specifics of their appeals. READ MORE FROM FOX BUSINESS Bitnomial’s lawsuit is the second one filed against the SEC this week. Digital asset exchange Crypto.com announced it was suing the agency on Tuesday, alleging the regulator is overstepping its jurisdiction by claiming that nearly all crypto assets are securities.
